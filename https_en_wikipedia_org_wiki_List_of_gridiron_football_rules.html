<p>American football is played on a football field that is 100 yards in total. 360 by 160 feet (109.7 by 48.8&#160;m).<sup id="cite_ref-Dimensions_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dimensions-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The longer boundary lines are <i>sidelines</i>, while the shorter boundary lines are <i>end lines</i>. Sidelines and end lines are out of bounds. Near each end of the field is a <i>goal line</i>; they are 100 yards (91.4&#160;m) apart. A scoring area called an <i><a href="/wiki/End_zone" title="End zone">end zone</a></i> extends 10 yards (9.1&#160;m) beyond each goal line to each end line. The end zone includes the goal line but not the end line.<sup id="cite_ref-Dimensions_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dimensions-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> While the playing field is effectively flat, it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown—with the middle of the field higher than the sides—to allow water to drain from the field.
</p><p><i>Yard lines</i> cross the field every 5 yards (4.6&#160;m), and are numbered every 10 yards from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> field). Two rows of short lines, known as inbounds lines or <i>hash marks</i>, run at 1-yard (91.4&#160;cm) intervals perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks. Because of the arrangement of the lines, the field is occasionally referred to as a gridiron.
</p><p>At the back of each end zone are two <i><a href="/wiki/Goalpost" class="mw-redirect" title="Goalpost">goalposts</a></i> (also called <i>uprights</i>) connected by a crossbar 10 feet (3.05&#160;m) from the ground. For high skill levels, the posts are 222 inches (5.64&#160;m) apart. For lower skill levels, these are widened to 280 inches (7.11&#160;m).
</p><p>Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of their players, if time allows, during the break between plays. As a result, players have very specialized roles, and, sometimes (although rarely) almost all of the (at least) 46 active players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate units: the <a href="/wiki/Offensive_team" class="mw-redirect" title="Offensive team">offense</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Defensive_team" class="mw-redirect" title="Defensive team">defense</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Special_teams" class="mw-redirect" title="Special teams">special teams</a>.

<p>Similarly to <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">association football</a>, the game begins with a <a href="/wiki/Coin_flipping" title="Coin flipping">coin toss</a> to determine which team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend.<sup id="cite_ref-Toss_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Toss-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The options are presented again to start the second half; the choices for the first half do not automatically determine the start of the second half (i.e. it is possible for the same team to kick off both halves).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The referee conducts the coin toss with the captains (or sometimes coaches) of the opposing teams. The team that wins the coin toss has three options:<sup id="cite_ref-Toss_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Toss-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
<ol><li>They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff.</li>
<li>They may choose which goal to defend.</li>
<li>They may choose to <i>defer</i> the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start the second half.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>

<p>A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters (12-minute quarters in high-school football and often shorter at lower levels, usually one minute per grade [e.g. 9-minute quarters for freshman games]),<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> with a 12-minute <a href="/wiki/Half-time" title="Half-time">half-time</a> intermission (30 minutes in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>) after the second quarter in the NFL (college halftimes are 20 minutes; in high school the interval is 15 or 20 minutes; 10 minutes for lower grades).<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beginner-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The clock stops after certain plays; therefore, a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time), and if a game is broadcast on <a href="/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a>, <a href="/wiki/Television_timeout" title="Television timeout">TV timeouts</a> are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast <a href="/wiki/Advertising" title="Advertising">commercials</a> outside of game action. If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play an additional period, timed like the fourth quarter, lasting up to 10 minutes. There is a coin toss in the NFL just like the beginning of the game. If the receiving team scores a touchdown during the possession, they win. If they kick a field goal, then the other team gets a possession. If they score a touchdown, they win. If they tie the score by kicking a field goal, then the next team that scores wins. If the team with the first possession turns the ball over without scoring any points, then the first team to score, wins. If the defense scores a touchdown through an interception or fumble recovery, or they get a safety, then they win. In a regular-season NFL game, if no one scores in the overtime, the game ends tied. In an NFL playoff game, multiple 15-minute overtime periods are played, as needed, to determine a winner. These periods are timed as if a game had started over. In the extremely rare case a game would go as far as a third OT—which has never happened in the NFL—there would be no "halftime intermission"; play would resume with a kickoff similar to a normal third quarter.

<p>Advancing the ball in American football resembles the <i>six-tackle rule</i> and the <i>play-the-ball</i> in <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>. The team that takes possession of the ball (the <b><a href="/wiki/American_football#Offense" title="American football">offense</a></b>) has four attempts, called <b><a href="/wiki/Down_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Down (football)">downs</a></b>, in which to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1&#160;m) toward their opponent's (the <b><a href="/wiki/American_football#Defense" title="American football">defense</a></b>'s) end zone. When the offense succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards, it gets a <b>first down</b>, meaning the team has another set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score. If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, the other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended, beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite direction.
</p><p>Except at the beginning of halves and after scores, the ball is always put into play by a <b><a href="/wiki/Snap_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Snap (American football)">snap</a></b>. Offensive players line up facing defensive players at the <b><a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a></b> (the position on the field where the play begins). One offensive player, the <b><a href="/wiki/Center_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Center (football)">center</a></b>, then passes (or "snaps") the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him, usually the <b><a href="/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a></b>.
</p><p>Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
</p>
<ol><li>By running with the ball, also known as <b><a href="/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)" title="Rush (gridiron football)">rushing</a></b>.</li>
<li>By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as a <b><a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" title="Forward pass">forward pass</a></b> or as <b>passing</b> the football. The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage. The ball can be thrown, pitched, handed-off, or tossed sideways or backwards at any time.</li></ol>
<p>A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
</p>
<ul><li>The player with the ball is forced to the ground (a <b><a href="/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)" title="Tackle (football move)">tackle</a></b>) or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an <b><a href="/wiki/Official_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Official (American football)">official</a></b>).</li>
<li>A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field (<b><a href="/wiki/Out_of_bounds" title="Out of bounds">out of bounds</a></b>) or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an <b><a href="/wiki/Incomplete_pass" title="Incomplete pass">incomplete pass</a></b>. The ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage for the next down.</li>
<li>The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.</li>
<li>A team scores.</li></ul>
<p>Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over.
</p><p>Before each down, each team chooses a <b><a href="/wiki/Football_play" class="mw-redirect" title="Football play">play</a></b>, or coordinated movements and actions, that the players should follow on a down. Sometimes, downs themselves are referred to as "plays."
</p>

<p>The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs:
</p>
<ul><li>The team fails to get a first down&#8212; i.e., in four downs they fail to move the ball past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first down (it is possible to be downed behind the current line of scrimmage, losing "yardage"). The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th-down play ends. A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a <b><a href="/wiki/Turnover_on_downs" title="Turnover on downs">turnover on downs</a></b>, but is not credited as a defensive "turnover" in official statistics. Instead, it goes against the offense's 4th down efficiency percentage.</li>
<li>The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a <b><a href="/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Kickoff (American football)">kickoff</a></b>.</li>
<li>The offense punts the ball to the defense. A <b><a href="/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)" title="Punt (gridiron football)">punt</a></b> is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down (though see <i><b><a href="/wiki/Quick_kick" title="Quick kick">quick kick</a></b></i>), when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to attempt a field goal.</li>
<li>A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an <b><a href="/wiki/Interception" title="Interception">interception</a></b>, and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores.</li>
<li>An offensive player drops the ball (a <b><a href="/wiki/Fumble" title="Fumble">fumble</a></b>) and a defensive player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. Backward passes that are not caught do not cause the down to end like incomplete forward passes do; instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as <b><a href="/wiki/Turnover_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Turnover (football)">turnovers</a></b>.</li>
<li>The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards (18.3&#160;m) of the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). If a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play, a defensive player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it.</li>
<li>While in his own end zone, an offensive ball carrier is tackled, forced out of bounds, loses the ball out of bounds, or the offense commits certain fouls. This fairly rare occurrence is called a <b><a href="/wiki/Safety_(American_football_score)" class="mw-redirect" title="Safety (American football score)">safety</a></b>.</li>
<li>An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone, and then the ball goes out of bounds. This extremely rare occurrence leads to a <b><a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a></b>, with the ball going over to the opposing team at their 20-yard line (Note that touchbacks during non-offensive special teams plays, such as punts and kickoffs, are quite common).</li></ul>

<p>A team scores points by the following plays:
</p>
<ul><li>A <b><a href="/wiki/Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdown</a></b> (TD) is worth 6 points.<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beginner-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> It is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone.<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beginner-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> A touchdown is analogous to a <a href="/wiki/Try_(rugby)" title="Try (rugby)">try</a> in rugby. Unlike rugby, a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score; a touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball but not while the ball is on or beyond the opponents' goal line (or the plane above it).
<ul><li>After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a <b><a href="/wiki/Try_(American_Football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Try (American Football)">try</a></b> (which is also analogous to the <a href="/wiki/Try_(rugby)" title="Try (rugby)">conversion in rugby</a>). The ball is placed at the other team's 3-yard (2.7&#160;m) line (the 2-yard (1.8&#160;m) line in the NFL on 2-point conversions or 15-yard (13.7&#160;m) for 1-point conversions). The team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an <b><a href="/wiki/Extra_point" class="mw-redirect" title="Extra point">extra point</a></b> or <b>point-after touchdown (PAT)<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></b>), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a <b><a href="/wiki/Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a></b>). In college football, the NFL, and Texas high school football, if the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two-point conversion attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone, the defensive team is awarded the two points.</li></ul></li>
<li>A <b><a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(gridiron_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Field goal (gridiron football)">field goal</a></b> (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts (uprights).<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beginner-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or <a href="/wiki/Drop_kick" title="Drop kick">drop-kicked</a> (extremely uncommon in the modern game, with only two successes in sixty-plus years in the NFL). A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the opponent's goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score. A <b><a href="/wiki/Fair_catch_kick" title="Fair catch kick">fair catch kick</a></b> is also 3.</li>
<li>A <b><a href="/wiki/Safety_(American_football_score)" class="mw-redirect" title="Safety (American football score)">safety</a></b>, worth 2 points, is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line. For instance, a safety is scored by the defense if an offensive player is tackled, goes out of bounds, or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone.<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beginner-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Safeties are relatively rare. Note that, though even more rare, the team initially on offense during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end zone where it becomes dead. However, if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the ball being there (for instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20-yard line. In amateur and pro football, in the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try, it is worth only 1 point.</li></ul>

<p>Each half begins with a <a href="/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Kickoff (American football)">kickoff</a>. Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team's own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line in the NFL and college football (as of the 2011 season). The other team's kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its <b>drive</b>, or series of offensive plays. If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a <b><a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a></b> by kneeling in the end zone, in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 20-yard line (25-yard line in NFL, since 2015). A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the end zone, or since 2018, the ball hits the ground on the goal line and in the end zone. A kickoff that goes out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul, and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or 30 yards (27&#160;m) from the kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team.<sup id="cite_ref-kickoff_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-kickoff-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Unlike with <a href="/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)" title="Punt (gridiron football)">punts</a>, once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground, it can be recovered by the kicking team.<sup id="cite_ref-kickoff_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-kickoff-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> A team, especially one who is losing, can try to take advantage of this by attempting an <a href="/wiki/Onside_kick" title="Onside kick">onside kick</a>.

<p>Variations on these basic rules exist, particularly <a href="/wiki/Touch_football_(American)" title="Touch football (American)">touch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flag_football" title="Flag football">flag football</a>, which are designed as non-contact or limited-contact alternatives to the relative <a href="/wiki/Violence" title="Violence">violence</a> of regular American football. In touch and flag football, tackling is not permitted. Offensive players are "tackled" when a defender tags them or removes a flag from their body, respectively. Both of these varieties are played mainly in informal settings such as <a href="/wiki/Intramural_sports" title="Intramural sports">intramural</a> or youth games. Another variation is "wrap", where a player is "tackled" when another player wraps his arms around the ball carrier. Professional, intercollegiate, and varsity-level high school football invariably use the standard tackling rules.
</p><p>Another variation is with the number of players on the field. In sparsely populated areas, it is not uncommon to find high school football teams playing <a href="/wiki/Nine-man_football" title="Nine-man football">nine-man football</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eight-man_football" title="Eight-man football">eight-man football</a> or <a href="/wiki/Six-man_football" title="Six-man football">six-man football</a>. Players often play on offense as well as defense. The <a href="/wiki/Arena_Football_League_(1987%E2%80%932008)" class="mw-redirect" title="Arena Football League (1987–2008)">Arena Football League</a> was a league that played eight-man football, but also had played indoors and on a much smaller playing surface with rule changes to encourage a much more offensive game.
</p><p>Another variation often played by American children is called Catch and Run. In this game, the children split into two teams and line up at opposite sides of the playing field. One side throws the ball to the other side. If the opposing team catches the ball, that player tries to run to the throwing teams touchdown without being tagged/tackled. If no one catches the ball or if the player is tagged/tackled, then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing team. This repeats until the game (or recess period) is deemed over.

<p>Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it became dead, but no nearer than 24 yards (22&#160;m) from the sideline or 1-yard (0.91&#160;m) from the goal line.<sup id="cite_ref-conversions_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-conversions-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is a sort of "no-man's land"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.

<p>On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to the quarterback or punter. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:
</p>
<ul><li>run with the ball, attempting to run farther downfield (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).</li>
<li><i>drop-kick</i> the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football, although in the Canadian game it is sometimes used as a last-second "desperation play" if the team is behind by less than three points.)</li>
<li>pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a <i>lateral</i>, and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a <i>forward pass</i> (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.</li>
<li><i>hand-off</i>—hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.</li>
<li><i>punt</i> the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it <i>before</i> it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the No Yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).</li>
<li>place the ball on the ground for a <i>place kick</i></li>
<li>throw a <i><a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" title="Forward pass">forward pass</a></i>, where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther downfield (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
<ul><li>They must be made from <i>behind</i> the line of scrimmage</li>
<li>Only one forward pass may be made on a play</li>
<li>The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Each play constitutes a <i>down</i>. The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards (9.1&#160;m) on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Field goal (football)">field goal</a> (see below), depending on their position on the field.
</p>

<p>The ball changes possession in the following instances:
</p>
<ul><li>If the offence scores a field goal, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>If the offence scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line. This also applies when the defence scores on a turnover which is returned for a touchdown — technically, they become the offence until the conclusion of the play, and the scoring team must still kickoff.</li>
<li>If the defence scores on a safety, they have the right to claim possession.</li>
<li>If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.</li>
<li>If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defense <i>takes over on downs</i>.</li>
<li>If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is <i>intercepted</i> by the defense; the defense takes possession immediately (and may try and advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.</li>
<li>If the offence <i>fumbles</i> (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.</li>
<li>If the offence has committed two consecutive <i>time counts</i> — failed to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the referee declaring the ball ready for play — on third down in the last three minutes of either half, the referee has the right to give possession to the defence. (This rule does not apply on convert attempts, which are untimed downs.)</li>
<li>When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half may receive a kickoff to start the second half.</li></ul>

<p>There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (as opposed to 5 yards (4.6&#160;m) in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infractions_and_penalties">Infractions and penalties</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Infractions and penalties">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Infractions of the rules are punished with <i>penalties</i>, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards (14&#160;m) against the penalized team.<sup id="cite_ref-conversions_12-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-conversions-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Minor violations such as <i>offside</i> (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards (9.1&#160;m), and severe violations (such as face-masking) of the rules are typically penalized 15 yards (14&#160;m). Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, the spot the violation occurred, or the place the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach in order to reach first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.
</p><p>Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offsides), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as <a href="/wiki/Unsportsmanlike_conduct" title="Unsportsmanlike conduct">unsportsmanlike conduct</a>).
</p><p>Penalties never result in a score for the offence (a penalty by the defence committed in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown); on rare occasions, penalties against the offence in their own end zone may result in a safety being scored by the defence. If the penalty yardage, once assessed would move the ball into an end zone (or further than half the distance between the end zone and the spot the penalty is assessed from), a penalty of half-the-distance is assessed instead. Note that in Canadian football (unlike American football), no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line.
</p><p>In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of <i>declining</i> the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs; the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. (After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback).

<p>Canadian football distinguishes three ways of kicking the ball:
</p>
<dl><dt><a href="/wiki/Place_kick" title="Place kick">Place kick</a></dt>
<dd>Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), placed on a tee.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Drop_kick" title="Drop kick">Drop kick</a></dt>
<dd>Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby</a> heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adapted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)" title="Punt (gridiron football)">Punt</a></dt>
<dd>Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.</dd></dl>
<p>On punts and field goal attempts (but not kickoffs), members of the kicking team, other than the kicker and any teammates who are onside (behind the kicker at the time of the kick), may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Scoring_2">Scoring</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22" title="Edit section: Scoring">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The methods of scoring are:
</p>
<dl><dt>Touchdown</dt>
<dd>Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's goal area, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a "major score" or simply a "major."</dd>
<dt>Conversion (or Convert)</dt>
<dd>After a touchdown, the team that scored attempts one scrimmage play from any point between the hash marks on or outside the opponents' 5-yard (4.6&#160;m) line. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point; what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a "two-point conversion"). No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).</dd>
<dt>Field goal</dt>
<dd>Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points.</dd>
<dt>Safety</dt>
<dd>Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a <i>single</i> (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), and they begin their first down possession play from their own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line on their side of the field.</dd>
<dt>Single</dt>
<dd>Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.</dd>
<dd>Officially, the single is called a <i>rouge</i> (<a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> for "red") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signaled with a red flag.</dd></dl>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Resumption_of_play">Resumption of play</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: Resumption of play">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.
</p>
<ul><li>Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).<sup id="cite_ref-conversions_12-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-conversions-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line.</li>
<li>Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line.</li>
<li>Following a single or <a href="/wiki/Rouge_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Rouge (football)">rouge</a>, play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard (32&#160;m) line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the 35-yard (32&#160;m) line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Game_timing">Game timing</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: Game timing">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A 2-minute interval occurs after the end of each quarter (15 minutes at halftime, except 30 minutes in <a href="/wiki/Grey_Cup" title="Grey Cup">Grey Cup</a>), and the two teams then change goals.
</p><p>In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
</p>
<ul><li>points are scored,</li>
<li>the ball goes out of bounds,</li>
<li>a forward pass is incomplete,</li>
<li>the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,</li>
<li>the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),</li>
<li>the ball is dead and a player is injured, or</li>
<li>the ball is dead and a captain calls a <a href="/wiki/Sport_time-out" class="mw-redirect" title="Sport time-out">time-out</a>.</li></ul>
<p>The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).
</p><p>In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play
</p>
<ul><li>the ball was kicked off,</li>
<li>the ball was punted,</li>
<li>the ball changed possession,</li>
<li>the ball went out of bounds,</li>
<li>there were points scored,</li>
<li>there was an incomplete forward pass,</li>
<li>there was a penalty applied (not declined), or</li>
<li>there was a team time-out.</li></ul>
<p>The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to <i>decline</i> any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing penalties.
</p><p>In the event of a tie after regulation, teams get one possession from the opponents' 35-yard line. The overtime is untimed. Coin toss determines whether team receives first or defend; the teams turn about for the next overtime possession, if needed. Whoever is ahead after one possession wins it and two points in standings; if after two possessions in the regular season or preseason, a tie still persists, the game ends drawn, and one point in standings; however, in postseason, multiple overtime possessions are repeated until whoever is up, which wins the game. If a touchdown has been scored they must make a two-point conversion, unless they score enough beat their opponents.

<p>Teams get 3 timeouts per half, which can't carry over to next half or overtime, plus one per overtime period (same as in the NFL, but allows two per overtime period).
Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determines the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics" title="National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules).
</p>
<ul><li>A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL both feet must be inbounds.</li>
<li>A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground (from a tackle or otherwise), with the sole exception of the holder for field goal and extra point attempts. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled or forced down another way by a member of the opposing team (down by contact).</li>
<li>The clock stops after the offense completes a first down and begins again—assuming it is following a play in which the clock would not normally stop—once  the referee declares the ball ready for play. In the NFL the clock does not explicitly stop for a first down.</li>
<li>Overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating ties. Since 2021, during overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock; the procedure repeats for one more possession if needed; all possessions thereafter will be from the opponent's 3-yard line. Whoever leads after both possessions will be declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue, with a coin flip determining the first possession. Possessions alternate with each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. A two-point conversion is required if a touchdown is scored in double overtime. From triple overtime, two-point conversions are employed hereafter. (In the NFL, overtime is decided by a 10-minute <a href="/wiki/Overtime_(sports)#American_and_Canadian_football" title="Overtime (sports)">sudden-death quarter</a>, and regular season games can still end in a tie if neither team scores. Overtime for regular season games in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> began with the <a href="/wiki/1974_NFL_season" title="1974 NFL season">1974</a> season, but reduced since <a href="/wiki/2017_NFL_season" title="2017 NFL season">2017</a>. In the post-season &amp; <a href="/wiki/Pro_Bowl" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a>, if the teams are still tied, teams will play multiple 15-minute overtime periods until whoever scores.)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Try_(American_Football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Try (American Football)">Extra point tries</a> are attempted from the three-yard line. The NFL uses the 2-yard line for 2-point conversions or 15-yard line for 1-point conversions.</li>
<li>The defensive team may score two points on a point-after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick, fumble, or interception into the opposition's end zone. In addition, if the defensive team gains possession, but then moves backwards into the endzone and is stopped, a one-point safety will be awarded to the offense, although, unlike a real safety, the offense kicks off, opposed to the team charged with the safety. In the NFL, a conversion attempt ends when the defending team gains possession of the football.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Two-minute_warning" title="Two-minute warning">two-minute warning</a> is not used in college football, except in rare cases where the scoreboard clock has malfunctioned and is not being used.</li>
<li>There is an option to use instant replay review of officiating decisions. Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools use replay in virtually all games; replay is rarely used in lower division games. Every play is subject to booth review with coaches only having one challenge. In the NFL, challenges are only automatic in the final two minutes of each half or the entire overtime.</li>
<li>In the 2006 season, the game clock was started when the ball was declared ready for play after the defensive team (during a scrimmage down) or the receiving kick (during a free kick down) was awarded a first down, reducing the time of games. This rule only lasted one year.</li>
<li>In the 1984 season, the ball was placed on the 30-yard line (instead of the 20) if a kickoff sailed through the end zone on the fly and untouched. This rule was rescinded after one year.</li>
<li>Among other rule changes to 2007, kickoffs have been moved from the 35-yard line back five yards to the 30-yard line to match that of the NFL. Some coaches and officials are questioning this rule change as it could lead to more injuries to the players as there will likely be more kickoff returns.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The rationale for the rule change was to help reduce dead time in the game.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> However, the NFL would move its kickoffs back to the 35-yard line for the 2011 season; the NCAA followed suit one year later.</li>
<li>Since the 2012 college football season, all touchbacks on kickoffs, or free kicks after a safety, have been spotted on the 25-yard line instead of the previous 20-yard spot (which remains the spot for touchbacks in all other game situations). The NFL made this same change effective with its 2018 season. In that same 2018 season, college football (but not the NFL) made a further change to its touchback rule; any fair catch on a kickoff (or free kick following a safety) between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line is treated as a touchback, with the receiving team taking possession on its own 25.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The four quarters are each 12 minutes, as opposed to 15 minutes in all other forms of the game; this includes Texas (all games).</li>
<li>Kickoffs take place at the kicking team's 40-yard line, as opposed to the 35 in college and the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a>. This rule is also used by Texas.</li>
<li>If a ball crosses the plane of the goal line on a missed <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Field goal (football)">field goal</a>, it would be a <a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a> and the opposing team will start at the 20-yard line. In Texas, the ball goes back to the line of scrimmage, except if the line of scrimmage was inside the 20-yard line, in which case, the ball is returned to the 20.</li>
<li>Any kick crossing the goal line is automatically a touchback; kicks cannot be returned out of the end zone.</li>
<li>Pass interference by the defense results in a 15-yard penalty, regardless of where the foul occurred (unlike the pro ranks where the ball is placed at the spot of the foul). (Like any other distance penalty, enforcement will not move the ball more than half the distance to the defense's goal line.)</li>
<li>The defense cannot return an extra-point attempt for a score, except in Texas.</li>
<li>The use of overtime, and the type of overtime used, is up to the individual state associations. In Texas, two-point conversions are required after touchdown in double overtime; triple overtime &amp; thereafter employs two-point conversions, all like the NCAA.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Intentional_grounding" title="Intentional grounding">Intentional grounding</a> may be called even if the quarterback is outside the <a href="/wiki/Glossary_of_American_football#T" class="mw-redirect" title="Glossary of American football">tackle box</a>. In Texas, once the quarterback leaves the tackle box, he only needs to throw the ball past the line of scrimmage to avoid this penalty.</li>
<li>The home team must wear dark-colored jerseys, and the visiting team must wear white jerseys. In the NFL, as well as conference games in the Southeastern Conference, the home team has choice of jersey color. Under general NCAA rules, the home team may wear white with approval of the visiting team.</li>
<li>NFHS rules specifically prohibit the use of <a href="/wiki/Replay_review_in_gridiron_football" title="Replay review in gridiron football">replay review</a>, even if the venue has the facilities to support it. In Texas, the public-school sanctioning body, the <a href="/wiki/University_Interscholastic_League" title="University Interscholastic League">University Interscholastic League</a>, only allows replay review in state championship games, while the main body governing non-public schools, the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Association_of_Private_and_Parochial_Schools" title="Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools">Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools</a>, follows the NFHS in banning replay review.</li></ul>
<p>At least one high school rule has been adopted by college football.  In 1996, the <a href="/wiki/Overtime_(sports)" title="Overtime (sports)">overtime</a> rules originally utilized by <a href="/wiki/Kansas_State_High_School_Activities_Association" title="Kansas State High School Activities Association">Kansas high school teams</a> were adopted by the <a href="/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a>, except with the starting point at the 25-yard line instead of the 10-yard line as prescribed in the NFHS rules, but under NFHS rules, states may opt to start each period from another point (such as the 20 or 25).

<p>Play in all forms of indoor football has tended to emphasize the forward passing game at the expense of rushing the football.  Whereas in a typical National Football League game perhaps half of the total offensive plays are rushing plays and 35 or 40 per cent of all of the yardage gained comes from rushing plays, in Arena and other indoor football it is far more common for rushing plays to constitute only 10 per cent of the offense, or even less in some instances.

<p>The first documented indoor football games were those played at <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in 1902 and 1903 known as the "<a href="/wiki/World_Series_of_Football_(1902)" class="mw-redirect" title="World Series of Football (1902)">World Series of Pro Football</a>." They were the first efforts at a national professional football championship. The games were played on a 70-yard by 35-yard dirt field but otherwise adhered to outdoor rules. Poor attendance led to the tournament being discontinued for 1904. Madison Square Garden had to be redone to accommodate the teams. The wooden flooring of the arena was removed and replaced by an earthen surface. The goal lines were only 70 yards apart and the playing field was only 35 yards wide. (Since was in the era before the <a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" title="Forward pass">forward pass</a>, there were no <a href="/wiki/End_zone" title="End zone">end zones</a>, as they had not yet been invented.) The earthen surface became sticky as the game progressed and made for some tough maneuvering, while the stands were right up to the playing field and proved to be a physical hazard.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The kicking game was also drastically affected. In a game on a normal field, the team with the longest punts had the advantage. However, the Gardens proved to be a dream for a weak punter, due to the field size. Also the arena wall was right on the edge of the field, presenting a serious hazard on any sideline plays. One player knocked himself out of the tournament by running into the wall on the opening kickoff.

<ul><li>The Field: An indoor padded surface 85 feet (26&#160;m) wide and 50 yards (46&#160;m) long with 8-yard (7.3&#160;m) endzones. Goal posts are 9 feet (2.7&#160;m) wide with a crossbar height of 15 feet (4.6&#160;m) (<a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> goalposts are 18.5 feet (5.6&#160;m) wide with the crossbar at 10 feet (3.0&#160;m)). The goalside rebound nets are 30 feet (9.1&#160;m) wide by 32 feet (9.8&#160;m) high. The bottom of the nets are 8 feet (2.4&#160;m) above the ground. Sideline barriers are 48 inches (1.2&#160;m) high and made of high density foam rubber.</li>
<li>The Equipment: The official football is the same size and weight as the National Football League ball.</li>
<li>The Players and Formations: Eight players on the field; 21-man active roster; four-man inactive roster.</li>
<li>Substitution: Free substitution is allowed, but some players play both ways either by choice or to step in because of <a href="/wiki/Injury" title="Injury">injury</a>.</li>
<li>Formation: Four (4) offensive players must line up on the line of scrimmage. Three (3) defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the "Mac Linebacker" may blitz on either side of the center. Alignment is two (2) or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: One receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.</li>
<li>Timing: Four 15-minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in <a href="/wiki/ArenaBowl" title="ArenaBowl">ArenaBowl</a>). The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays or incomplete passes only in the last half-minute of regulation &amp; overtime or when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts; as in the NFL, any injury in last half-minute of regulation or overtime costs that team a timeout, unless they have none and this occurs, when they are granted one. Each team is allowed three (3) time-outs per half, and two per overtime period if regulation ends tied. In the last half-minute of the game, the clock will run if team has lead and quarterback decides to kneel down. 30-second play clock.</li>
<li>Movement of the Ball and Scoring: Four (4) downs are allowed to advance the ball ten (10) yards for a first down, or to score. Six (6) points for a touchdown. One (1) point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown or if safety is scored off any conversion attempt, two (2) points for a conversion by drop kick and two (2) points for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three (3) points for a field goal or fair catch kick by placement or four (4) points by drop kick. Two (2) points for safeties or defending team's turnover off conversion attempt returned for touchdown.</li>
<li>Kicking: Kickoffs are from the goal line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. Punting is illegal. On fourth down, a team may go for a first down, touchdown or field goal. The receiving team may field any kickoff or missed field goal that rebounds off the net. Any kickoff untouched which is out of bounds or hitting an overhead structure (i.e. scoreboard) will be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal "slack net" or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will come out to the 5-yard line. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the end zone and under the net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the endzone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the endzone, the ball is placed on the 2½-yard line.</li>
<li>Passing: Passing rules in Arena Football are the same as outdoor <a href="/wiki/NCAA_football" class="mw-redirect" title="NCAA football">NCAA football</a> in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface.</li>
<li>Overtime Rules: Overtime periods are 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs. In the first overtime each team gets one possession to score. Whoever is ahead after one possession will win. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, whoever scores next will win. Multiple overtime periods will be played in case of a tie and play continues in true <a href="/wiki/Sudden_death_(sports)" class="mw-redirect" title="Sudden death (sports)">sudden death</a> thereafter. This includes both games of all semifinal series.</li>
<li>Coaching challenges: coaches are allowed 2 (two) challenges per game; to do so, coaches throw the red flag before the next play. If the play stands as called after the play is reviewed they lose a timeout; however, if it is reversed they keep their timeouts. If a team wins two straight challenges they are granted a third. All challenges are automatic in the final half-minute of regulation &amp; all overtime periods, as does scoring plays &amp; turnovers.</li>
<li>Defending players may not jump offside twice in either half; they risk ejection for rest of half if they do. They cannot jump offside during overtime, or they risk immediate disqualification. This penalty is enforced besides yardage penalty.</li>
<li>Any player who targets, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty.</li></ul>

<p><b>Field Size</b> – 50 yards long by 25 yards wide, with end zones a minimum of 5 yards in depth. Fields may vary in size due to physical constraints within facility, with CIFL permission. End zones may be rounded due to hockey board configurations. Padded dasher board walls around the entire field that act as an extension of the ground (only "out of bounds" if contact made by opposing player that forces player into the dasher wall, much like a ‘down by contact’ rule).
</p><p><b>Goal Posts</b> – Goal posts are 12 feet from the floor to the crossbar. The crossbar is 10 feet wide. Anything used to hang the goalpost is considered a part of the upright.
</p><p><b>Number Of Players</b> – Seven players per team on the field at one time. Maximum of 20 active players with a 21st player that is only eligible for special-teams plays (kickoffs, field goals, point-after-touchdown plays).
</p><p><b>Playing Time</b> – Four 15-minute quarters with a running clock. Clock only stops for incomplete passes and out of bounds plays during the final minute of the halves. 25-second play clock.
</p><p><b>Scoring</b> – 6 points for TD, 2 points for run or pass conversion, or drop kick PAT, 1 point for place kick PAT, 2 points for defensive conversion following TD, 2 points for safety. 3 points for a field goal, 4 points for a drop kick field goal.
</p><p><b>Backfield in Motion</b> – One player may be in motion in any direction behind the line of scrimmage prior to the snap.
</p><p><b>Offensive Linemen</b> – Three linemen must be in a three- or four-point stance prior to the snap. They must line up guard, center, guard and next to one another. Any offensive lineman not covered up by the fourth man on the line of scrimmage is an eligible receiver if he is wearing an eligible receiver number (1-49, 80-89).
</p><p><b>Defensive Linemen</b> – There must be three defensive linemen, and they must line up on the nose, or can line up inside foot-to-outside foot outside of an offensive lineman Linemen must rush inside if nose up or slanted into if shaded, and they must make contact before any movement to the outside is made.
</p><p><b>Blitzing</b> – Only one non-lineman can blitz at a time. This player can blitz from any direction, but must be at least five yards off the line of scrimmage/goal line prior to the snap. Players do not have to announce their eligibility to blitz.
</p><p><b>Linebackers</b> – At least two defensive players must line up at least 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. The other two non-linemen must either line up face-to-face with an offensive non-lineman on the line, or be five yards behind the line of scrimmage. After the snap, this rule is eliminated and the players can roam anywhere they wish, provided it does not violate blitzing rules. Linebackers can line up at the goal line if the offense is within five yards of scoring.
</p><p><b>Kickoffs</b> – If a kickoff leaves the field of play on the fly, the ball comes out to the 25-yard line. The sideline walls and end zone walls are not out of bounds, and balls can be played off of them. If a kickoff leaves the field of play after making contact with the field or a player on either team, the ball comes out to the 5-yard line, or the point in which it leaves the field of play, whichever is closest to the kicking team's goal line.
</p><p><b>Offense</b> – No punting. Offense must attempt to gain a first down or touchdown, or may attempt a field goal (by placement or drop kick).
</p><p><b>Coaches</b> – One coach from each team is allowed on the field during game time, but must stay a required distance from the dasher boards.
</p><p><b>Overtime</b> – Overtime is played with NCAA-style rules (each team gets one possession), but each possession is started with a kickoff rather than at the 25-yard line. Teams must go for a two-point conversion (by scrimmage play) starting with the third overtime session.
</p><p>The most notable rule difference in the CIFL from other indoor football leagues is that the CIFL plays seven players to a side, as opposed to most indoor leagues, which play <a href="/wiki/Eight-man_football" title="Eight-man football">eight men to a side</a>.
</p><p>The league does not utilize a rebound net, but otherwise, its rules are nearly identical to those of the <a href="/wiki/Arena_Football_League_(1987%E2%80%932008)" class="mw-redirect" title="Arena Football League (1987–2008)">Arena Football League</a>.

<p>A game consists of four 15-minute quarters with a 20-minute halftime intermission.  The clock typically only stops for time-outs, penalties, injuries, and official clarifications.  Further stoppages occur for incomplete passes and out of bounds during the final 90 seconds of the halves.  A mandatory official's time-out, called a <b>promotional timeout</b>, is assessed after the first and fourth quarters and is 90 seconds in duration.  Another mandatory official's time-out, called a warning period, is assessed with 90 seconds to play at the end of each half.  The game may also be stopped for further promotional time-outs, but must not exceed 90 seconds per league rules.

<p>The teams organize each other at the beginning of the game; if there are no pre-selected teams, a draft is held on the spot from the available players. In the event of an odd number of players, one player will usually serve as an "all time quarterback," who plays on offense the whole game and cannot run the ball past the line of scrimmage, or, if more players are on their way, the team who is short handed will automatically draft the newcomer upon arrival.
</p><p>The two teams organize on opposite sides of the field for the kickoff. Because of skill, field size and other issues, this is usually not a kickoff but rather a punt-off or a throw-off. Many versions skip this process and start the offense at a certain point, similar to a <a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a> in <a href="/wiki/NFL" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL">NFL</a> or other national leagues.
</p><p>As in regular American football, each team usually has four downs per series. In order to achieve a series of downs, backyard football requires the team with the ball to complete two passes or reach a certain point on the field. Few games include enough people to run a <a href="/wiki/Chain_crew" title="Chain crew">chain crew</a> to maintain the 10 yard familiar in most organized leagues. These structures encourages passing plays over running, as does the usual lack of offensive and defensive lines. Play continues until there is a turnover on downs (i.e. the offensive team fails to complete two passes in four downs), an <a href="/wiki/Interception" title="Interception">interception</a> occurs, or the team on offense scores a <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdown</a>. Touchdowns are worth 6, 7, or 1 point(s) depending on the rules set out before the game.
</p><p>Field goals and extra point kicks are nonexistent (streets and backyards have no goal posts), although punts can frequently happen, usually during "4th and 2 completions" situations where the offensive team cannot earn a first down. (In games played on regulation fields, these kicks can be attempted, but only in certain scoring systems.)
</p><p>In the event a touchdown is scored, the team on offense will normally stay in the end zone in which they had just scored and the other team will go into the main field and field the subsequent kickoff. Thus, until an interception or turnover on downs, both teams defend and attempt to score on the same end zone.
</p><p>Rules greatly vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, and are customarily set before each game. There can be a rush on the QB depending on the rules set out before the game. Usually if rushes are allowed, there are 2 rules that are commonly applied; Call rush and blitz count. Call rush is the first rule of rushing the QB in street. This is where the defense calls "Blitz" in a loud voice before the offense hikes the ball, signifying that they will rush, but there is also a counter effect with this. The QB can get out of the pocket and run without having to pass or hand off the ball, also the quarterback can call "shotgun" before or after the other team says "blitz" causing the opposite to have to count to 5 or 10 depending on whether or not they called blitz 5 calling "<a href="/wiki/Shotgun_formation" title="Shotgun formation">shotgun</a>" adds 5 seconds to the blitz count.  The second, and more common, rush QB rule is Mississippi rush (a blitz count), so called because the blitzing player must insert the word "<a href="/wiki/Mississippi" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>" between numbers so as not to allow the player to count ridiculously fast and effectively give the quarterback no time to throw.  Sometimes the two rules are combined, allowing one separate call of "Blitz!" per set of 4 downs.  The other option to handle a rush is to use an offensive lineman or center to block any pass rush. A line is rare in street, and the act of a center snapping to a quarterback is completely optional. Most teams that use a line opt for 3 down linemen(1 center and 2 guards). Some organizations that don't require the center to snap the ball to the quarterback only use 2 linemen.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">Conversions after a TD</a> usually aren't applied and they can only be attempted from the 6 (or occasionally 7) point TD system, but if they are, there are several conversion systems, including "single point," "pass-run," yardage and "runback." The single-point is the simplest of the rules, in which any successful conversion is worth one point. Pass run is used in some midget leagues and awards 2 points for a pass and one point for a run. Usually all pass-run conversions are attempted from the 1 or 2-yard line. The second conversion system is the yardage system, similar to that used in the <a href="/wiki/XFL_(2001)" title="XFL (2001)">XFL</a> playoffs and the proposed <a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_Football_League_(2010)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="United States Football League (2010) (page does not exist)">New USFL</a>. The yardage system is formatted like this: 1 point conversions are attempted from the 1 or 5-yard line, and 2-point conversions are attempted from the 2 or 10-yard line. The runback is the most rare of the conversion rules, and is most often implemented in one-on-one games. In this version, the play does not end once the ball crosses the goal line; instead, the player with the ball must change direction and advance it all the way back to the other end zone for two points.
</p><p>The game ends when a pre-determined number of touchdowns or points has been scored, or an arbitrary time is reached (for instance, dusk or the start of school).
</p><p>Penalties are rare and are usually only enforced in the most egregious cases, such as serious injuries.

<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"/><div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Touch_football_(American)" title="Touch football (American)">Touch football (American)</a></div>
<p>Depending on the skill of the players, the available playing field, and the purpose of the game, the rules other than the tackling aspect may remain mostly the same or vary considerably from traditional American football.  Touch football can be played by teams as few as two or as many as eleven on each side; usually, games consist of teams of four to seven.
</p><p>Positions in touch football are far less formal than its more organized counterpart. While some games roughly follow conventions, more often, all players will be considered <a href="/wiki/Eligible_receiver" title="Eligible receiver">eligible receivers</a> (as in <a href="/wiki/Six-man_football" title="Six-man football">six-man football</a>), and there are usually no <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running backs</a>. There may or may not be a <a href="/wiki/Center_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Center (American football)">snapper</a>; if there is not, the quarterback initiates play by hovering the ball above the line of scrimmage and pulling it backward to simulate a snap.
</p><p>Generally, in touch football, nearly every play is a passing play, whereas run plays and pass plays tend to be well balanced in organized football.  Some games will also implement a "blitz count", or a period of time that must elapse after the <a href="/wiki/Snap_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Snap (American football)">snap</a> before the defense may cross the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> in order to attempt to tackle the <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a>.  The count thus gives the quarterback time to complete a <a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" title="Forward pass">pass</a> in the absence of effective blocking (when teams are small, there is often no blocking at all).  Other games will not use a count and thus blocking becomes important. Conversely, in the presence of a "blitz count" there is also often a "QB sneak" rule, which prevents the quarterback from taking unfair advantage of the blitz count by preventing the quarterback from crossing the line of scrimmage before the blitz count is finished.
</p><p>Because of these rules, passing plays are far more common than running plays in touch football.
</p><p>Along with the size of the teams, the size of the field can vary considerably.  In a park, or spring practice situation, a full-sized field may be available, but many games are played in the front and back yards of suburban and rural village neighborhoods, where the whole field may not be much more than ten to thirty yards long.  In most of these situations, there are no yard lines, requiring some change in the definition of a <a href="/wiki/First_down" class="mw-redirect" title="First down">first down</a>.  Instead of requiring that a team advance the ball ten yards, sometimes two pass completions result in a first down.  Another option is to eliminate first downs entirely, so that a team gets four (sometimes five) chances to score.
</p><p>When it is desired for an odd number of players to play, it is common to allow one player to be an "all-time Quarterback" player; this player will always be on the <a href="/wiki/Offense_(sports)" title="Offense (sports)">offense</a> or the kicking team, switching sides throughout the game. When this occurs, there is usually no blitz count and the all-time quarterback is usually never allowed to cross the line of scrimmage.
</p><p>Another common variation is the elimination of the <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Field goal (football)">field goal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Extra_point" class="mw-redirect" title="Extra point">extra point</a> kick; this is usually due to the absence of goal posts and tees on the field as well as due to poor kicking skill by the participants.  Some games eliminate kicking altogether, directing the teams to start each possession after a <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdown</a> at the twenty-yard line, as if a <a href="/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Kickoff (American football)">kickoff</a> and <a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a> had just occurred; other players prefer to change the kickoff into a "throw-off" or a "<a href="/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)" title="Punt (gridiron football)">punt</a>-off."
</p><p>Scoring and game timing are much different in touch football than its more organized counterpart. For the sake of simplicity, <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdowns</a> are usually worth 1 point and no other scoring is counted (there are no <a href="/wiki/Extra_point" class="mw-redirect" title="Extra point">extra point</a> attempts). In a much lesser used variation, a touchdown is worth 6 points and if the player who scored the touchdown can progress in the other direction from the end zone in which he had just scored back to the opposite end zone without being touched, it counts as a <a href="/wiki/Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a>. The former scoring method does not allow for other scoring types such as <a href="/wiki/Safety_(American_football_score)" class="mw-redirect" title="Safety (American football score)">safeties</a>. There is usually no <a href="/wiki/Game_clock" class="mw-redirect" title="Game clock">game clock</a> and the game ends when one opponent has reached 10 touchdowns (in the former convention) or 100 points (in a standard convention).

<p>The NFL adopted many ideas introduced by the AFL, including names on player jerseys and revenue sharing of gate and television receipts.  The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a <a href="/wiki/Stopwatch" title="Stopwatch">stopwatch</a> used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960.  The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it; it has been 16-game seasons since 1978.  The AFL also introduced the <a href="/wiki/Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a> to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s).  All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's pro football more like the <i>AFL</i> than like the old-line NFL.  The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States.

<p>The NFL has traditionally used a <a href="/wiki/Sudden_death_(sport)" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a> format for overtime. Regular-season games have a single period of overtime during which the first team to score wins the game. If neither team scores, the game is declared a tie. In post-season games, overtime is extended indefinitely until one team scores. In NFL Europa, however, the overtime period lasted for 10 minutes with the requirement that each team must have the opportunity of possession at least once. So, in NFL Europa, it was possible for one team to score in overtime, then have to kick off to the opponent and give them a chance to either equalize or win the game. The winner was the team with the highest score after both teams had had possession. If the score was even after the second team's possession, the overtime would continue as sudden death.  If still tied after 10 minutes, the game ends as a tie.  Only two games ever remained tied after overtime in WLAF/NFL Europa history: London Monarchs versus <a href="/wiki/Birmingham_Fire" title="Birmingham Fire">Birmingham Fire</a> in Week 4 of the 1992 season, and Berlin Thunder at Hamburg Sea Devils, on April 1, 2006. The score of both games was 17–17.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>With <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">association football</a> being the traditionally popular sport in Europe and <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">American football</a> being a relative newcomer, the rules were changed slightly to encourage a greater element of kicking, which was intended to make the game more enjoyable for football and <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby</a> fans. The league did this by awarding 4 points to <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Field goal (football)">field goals</a> of more than 50 yards, as opposed to 3 points in the NFL. This had the interesting side-effect that a touchdown and PAT lead (7 points) could be equaled by one regular field goal (3 points) as well as a long field goal (4 points). This concept would later be adopted by the proposed <a href="/w/index.php?title=United_States_Football_League_(2010)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="United States Football League (2010) (page does not exist)">New United States Football League</a>, with the distance required for the fourth point increased from 50 to 55 yards.
</p><p>Also, there was a requirement that at least one player of Non-American extraction, referred to as "national" players, participate in every down for both teams as of the 2006 season (in previous seasons one was required to play only on every down of every other series). In addition to European players a number of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> players played as national players. Up until the 2004 season, kicked conversion attempts and short field goals were attempted by national players. Since there are few European players who have had the chance to compete at a level comparable to U.S. <a href="/wiki/College_football" title="College football">college football</a> and the NFL, many, if not most, of the European players ended up as kickers.

<p>Like previous football leagues, the UFL has instituted several mostly minor rules changes that will differ from the NFL's rules. Though the league has indicated it would mostly adhere to standard rules, there are a few differences, as follows:
</p>
<ul><li><b>No Tuck Rule</b> - The <a href="/wiki/Tuck_rule_(American_football)" title="Tuck rule (American football)">Tuck rule</a> is one of the most controversial rules in the NFL. In the NFL, if a passer brings his arm forward in a passing motion and then loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, it's considered a forward pass (and thus an incomplete pass if the ball hits the ground). In the UFL, it would be called a fumble.</li>
<li><b>Touchdown celebrations</b> - Celebrations, individual or group, will only take place in the endzones and on the bench area.</li>
<li><b>Fumbling out of the endzones</b>- If the ball is fumbled out of the endzone, it will be placed back at the spot of the fumble, pending which team last had possession.</li>
<li><b>Intentional grounding</b> - A quarterback is allowed to intentionally ground the ball anywhere behind the line of scrimmage if he is under pressure.</li>
<li><b>Instant replay</b> - All reviews will be viewed upstairs by the replay official and he will only have 90 seconds for review.</li>
<li><b>Overtime</b> - Both teams will be guaranteed at least one possession. When a team scores, the other team will get a last chance to score on the next drive.</li>
<li><b>Standardized uniforms</b> - Unlike most other leagues, the UFL's four inaugural teams have uniforms with identical designs, with the only differences being the colors of the jerseys—black for New York, silver for Las Vegas (an homage to the team's home stadium, formerly known as the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Bowl" class="mw-redirect" title="Silver Bowl">Silver Bowl</a>), blue for Florida, green for California. The team's logo consists of a two-letter abbreviation indicating its home. As such, the league will not need to use separate "home and away" dark and light jerseys.</li></ul>

<p>The WFL had several important rules differences from the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> of that era, and many were eventually adopted by the older league:
</p>
<ul><li>Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6.</li>
<li>Conversions were called "Action Points" and could <b>only</b> be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in other football leagues), and were worth one point. The ball was placed on the five-yard line for an Action Point. This rule was a revival of a 1968 preseason experiment by the NFL and <a href="/wiki/American_Football_League" title="American Football League">American Football League</a>. The <a href="/wiki/XFL_(2001)" title="XFL (2001)">XFL</a> employed a similar rule 27 years later.</li>
<li>Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Before 1974, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; from 1974 to 1993 &amp; since 2011, the NFL moved its kickoffs back to the 35, and from 1994 to 2010, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30.</li>
<li>Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of two feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football, the Arena Football League, and the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Football_League" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> have always used the one-foot rule.</li>
<li>Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL later adopted this rule, with a 5-yard bump zone.</li>
<li>The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. Starting with the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line.</li>
<li>Missed field goals were returned to the line of scrimmage or the 20-yard line, whichever was farther from the goal line. The NFL also adopted this rule for its 1974 season, then replaced the line of scrimmage with the point of the kick in 1994.  Before this rule, missed field goals were (if unreturned) touchbacks, with the ball placed at the 20-yard line.  U.S. college football later adopted this rule, but left the point as the line of scrimmage rather than the point of the placement.</li>
<li>A player in motion was allowed to move toward the line of scrimmage before the snap, as long as he was behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. This rule had never been used at any level of outdoor American football, but was (and still is) part of <a href="/wiki/Canadian_football" title="Canadian football">Canadian football</a>. This rule is used in the Arena Football League and was used in the XFL.</li>
<li>Punt returners were prohibited from using the fair catch, although the covering team could not come within 5 yards of the kick returner until he caught the ball. This rule also came from Canadian football, which still uses it, as does Arena football with kickoffs and missed field goals.  The XFL also used the so-called "halo rule".</li>
<li>Penalties for offensive holding and ineligible receiver downfield were 10&#160;yards, instead of 15. Several years later, these became 10-yard penalties at all levels of football. Still later, the ineligible receiver penalty was changed to 5&#160;yards (with loss of down).</li>
<li>The WFL's original overtime system was like nothing used in any form of American football before or since; it was more similar to the system long used in international <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">soccer</a>. Overtime in the regular season was one fixed 15-minute period, divided into two halves of 7½ minutes, each starting with a kickoff by one of the teams. The complete overtime was always played; there was no "sudden death" feature. In 1975, the WFL changed its overtime to the 15-minute sudden-death period, which the NFL adopted in 1974 and still uses today, albeit 5 minutes shorter since 2017.</li>
<li><b>Limited (or no) pre-season games.</b>  In 1974 and 1975, NFL teams played six pre-season games and 14 regular-season games (which was changed in 1978 to the current four pre-season and 16 regular-season games).  In contrast, the WFL's 1974 schedule called for 20 regular-season games and no pre-season games; in 1975, it was 18 regular-season games and two pre-season games.</li>
<li><b>Summertime football.</b>  The NFL's regular season started on September 15 in 1974 and on September 21 in 1975; the WFL's regular season started on July 10 in 1974 and on July 26 in 1975 (with the 1975 pre-season starting on July 5). The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Football_League" title="Canadian Football League">Canadian Football League</a>, which must contend with colder winters than American leagues, has always played during the summer with a similar schedule.</li>
<li><b>Weeknight football</b> (1974).  While NFL games were played mostly on Sundays and a game on <a href="/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night</a>, the WFL's 1974 schedule called for Wednesday night football (with a Thursday night national TV game). This scheduling format was abandoned in 1975. The featured Thursday night game was later adopted as "<a href="/wiki/Run_to_the_Playoffs" class="mw-redirect" title="Run to the Playoffs">Thursday Night Football</a>" by the NFL in 2006.</li>
<li><b>The "Dickerod"</b>. Instead of using a ten-yard chain strung between two sticks for measuring first down yardage, the WFL used a device called the "Dickerod," obstensibly named for its inventor. This was a single stick, roughly ten feet tall, mounted on a base which allowed it to pivot from side to side. The stick was swung down to ground level when a first down was being set, and a marker that slid along the shaft was fixed in place to line up with the nearest gridiron line (the major yard lines spaced every five yards). When that was set, the stick was swung back to the upright position. When a measurement was needed by the officials, the Dickerod was brought out to the ball position, the shaft swung down to ground level, the marker lined up with the nearest gridiron line, and the measurement was taken. (In all other forms of football today, a similar marker is clipped to the standard ten-yard chain, also lining up with a gridiron line.)</li></ul>

<p>Despite boasts by <a href="/wiki/WWE" title="WWE">WWF</a> promoters of a "rules-light" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played a brand of 11-man outdoor football that was recognizable, aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some modified during the season. In fact, most of the rule changes were inherited from the 1970s <a href="/wiki/World_Football_League" title="World Football League">World Football League</a>.

<p>All XFL teams had to play in outdoor stadiums with grass surfaces.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> No domed stadiums, artificial turf stadiums, or <a href="/wiki/Retractable_roof" title="Retractable roof">retractable roof</a> stadiums were allowed. (This happened to occur during now-extinct <a href="/wiki/Giants_Stadium" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a>'s brief experiment with natural grass; the stadium's turf did not hold up well in the winter and early spring weather and the stadium reverted to its traditional artificial turf in 2003.)

<p>Replacing the <a href="/wiki/Coin_toss" class="mw-redirect" title="Coin toss">coin toss</a> at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team sought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side by side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The scramble led to the first XFL injury: <a href="/wiki/Orlando_Rage" title="Orlando Rage">Orlando Rage</a> free safety <a href="/wiki/Hassan_Shamsid-Deen" title="Hassan Shamsid-Deen">Hassan Shamsid-Deen</a> separated his shoulder in the scramble during the XFL's opening weekend.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdowns</a> there were no extra point kicks, due to the XFL's perception that an extra point kick was a "guaranteed point." To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL <a href="/wiki/Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a>), but for just a single point. By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line.
</p><p>This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the <a href="/wiki/World_Football_League" title="World Football League">WFL</a>'s "Action Point," and was identical to a 1968 experiment by the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_Football_League" title="American Football League">American Football League</a>, used only in preseason interleague games that year.
</p>

<p>Ties were resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and present-day CFL game, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs &#8211; teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bump_and_run">Bump and run</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58" title="Edit section: Bump and run">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The XFL allowed full <a href="/wiki/Bump_and_run_coverage" title="Bump and run coverage">bump and run coverage</a> early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side (similar to the NCAA). In an effort to increase offensive production, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL) following the fourth week of the season.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Forward_motion">Forward motion</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=59" title="Edit section: Forward motion">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Unlike the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a>, but like the <a href="/wiki/World_Football_League" title="World Football League">World Football League</a> and Arena football before it, the XFL allowed one offensive player to move toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.
</p>
<h4><span id="Halo_rule_.2F_live_punts"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Halo_rule_/_live_punts">Halo rule / live punts</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60" title="Edit section: Halo rule / live punts">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The heavily hyped "no <a href="/wiki/Fair_catch" title="Fair catch">fair catch</a>" rule (announcers tended to mention it on almost every punt/kickoff) was paired with a five-yard zone excluding players of the kicking team around potential returners before the ball touched them or the ground, similar to rules in <a href="/wiki/Canadian_football" title="Canadian football">Canadian football</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a>, and contemporary NCAA rules (where the term "halo" was applied, though the XFL called it instead the "danger zone"). But instead of making punt returns more exciting, it often had the opposite effect, since the XFL players' inexperience with the rule caused a high number of game-delaying penalties.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Fair_catch" title="Fair catch">fair catch</a> had previously been abolished from Canadian rules, NCAA rules (but only for the 1950 season), and <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" title="Rugby league">Rugby league</a>.
</p><p>Another difference was that after touching ground 25 yards or more beyond the line of scrimmage, punts could be recovered and advanced by all players of the kicking team.  This led to more <a href="/wiki/Quick_kick" title="Quick kick">quick kicks</a> being taken on third-down-and-long situations in the one season of the small league than had been seen in the NFL over several preceding decades of longer seasons.  XFL's "innovation" was similar to a rule that had been in effect in American football in the 1910s and part of the 1920s.
</p><p>XFL penalized 10 yards from the succeeding spot punts going out of bounds, even if they first touched the ground (but not a player of the receiving team).
</p><p>For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.
</p><p>The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back.
</p>

<p>The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players (roughly analogous to the 42 for CFL rosters, as opposed to 53 on NFL teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters). This resulted, most commonly, in each team only carrying two quarterbacks and one kicker, who doubled as the punter.
</p><p>The XFL paid standardized player salaries. <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">Quarterbacks</a> earned <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">U.S. $</a>5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions (<a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Xtreme" title="Los Angeles Xtreme">Los Angeles Xtreme</a> players <a href="/wiki/Noel_Prefontaine" title="Noel Prefontaine">Noel Prefontaine</a>, the league's lone punting specialist, and <a href="/wiki/Matt_Malloy" title="Matt Malloy">Matt Malloy</a>, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a playoff game. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Furthermore, players did not receive any fringe benefits, meaning players had to pay for their own health insurance.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alliance_of_American_Football">Alliance of American Football</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=62" title="Edit section: Alliance of American Football">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>

<p>The Alliance of American Football (AAF), which folded before the end of its inaugural 2019 season, had several significant rule differences from other leagues.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kickoffs">Kickoffs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=63" title="Edit section: Kickoffs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The AAF eliminated kickoffs. Possession at the start of each half, or after any offensive score, began on the "receiving" team's 25-yard line (the same point as the NFL then used after touchbacks on kickoffs), barring the "kicking" team choosing to attempt an "onside conversion". After a safety, the scoring team would take possession at its own 35-yard line, again with the caveat that the scored-upon team could attempt an onside conversion.
</p><p>The onside conversion, which replaced the onside kick, was a play unique to the AAF. Following an offensive score, a team could choose to attempt a scrimmage play from its own 28-yard line; if it gained 12 or more yards on that play, it would keep possession, with play resuming from the final spot of the ball. A failed attempt would result in the scored-upon team taking possession at the final spot of the ball. This play could only be attempted if the scoring team was trailing by at least 17 points at any time in the game, or during the last 2 minutes of the first half or last 5 minutes of the game. The onside conversion was also available to the scored-upon team following a safety (with the same restrictions regarding score and/or time remaining), with the spot of the play being that team's own 18-yard line and the required distance to gain being the same 12 yards.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Defensive_restrictions">Defensive restrictions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64" title="Edit section: Defensive restrictions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The defense could not advance more than five players across the line of scrimmage, and no defensive player could cross the line of scrimmage from more than 2 yards outside the offensive tackles. Violations were categorized as "illegal defense" and resulted in a 15-yard penalty.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Conversions">Conversions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=65" title="Edit section: Conversions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The AAF prohibited conversion kicks—all conversion attempts were required to be regular scrimmage plays (runs or passes), and if successful were scored as two-point conversions.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Overtime_2">Overtime</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Overtime">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>In regular-season play, only one overtime period was played, using "Kansas Playoff" rules with the spot of possession being the defensive team's 10-yard line. Each team had four downs to score a touchdown, with a score followed by a two-point conversion attempt. Field goals were prohibited. If the game remained tied after each team had one possession, it ended in a tie. Reports varied on the overtime system the AAF would have used if it had reached the postseason.

<p>NWFA teams play according to standard <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> rules with the following notable exceptions:
</p>
<ul><li>TDY-sized football</li>
<li>only one foot in-bounds is required for a reception</li>
<li>no blocking below the waist downfield</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legends_Football_League">Legends Football League</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_gridiron_football_rules&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Legends Football League">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Play style is full-contact. Uniforms consist of helmets, shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, sports bras, and shorts.
</p><p>There are no <a href="/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)" title="Kickoff (gridiron football)">kickoffs</a> nor field goals, punts are allowed if inside their own 10-yard line; halves and after scores begin on their own 15-yard line.<sup id="cite_ref-Philly_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Philly-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> A team must attempt to get a first down on every fourth down. After a touchdown, a team can attempt a one-point conversion from the one-yard line, or a two-point conversion from the three-yard line. The defending team can run the ball toward their end zone for 2 points off conversion attempts; offending team can get 1 point if safety is scored off conversion attempts.
</p><p>There are seven women on each side of the 50-yard field, one player less than in <a href="/wiki/Arena_football" title="Arena football">arena football</a>. Teams consist of 18 players, of which 12 are active on game day. This means at least 3 or 4 players play both ways, as "iron women". But coaches are allowed <a href="/wiki/Free_substitution" title="Free substitution">free substitution</a>.
</p><p>The standard offensive formation features 1 <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a>, 2 <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running backs</a>, 1 <a href="/wiki/Center_(American_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Center (American football)">center</a>, and 3 <a href="/wiki/Wide_receiver" title="Wide receiver">wide receivers</a>. The standard defensive formation features 2 <a href="/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)#Defensive_line" class="mw-redirect" title="Lineman (American football)">defensive linewomen</a>, 2 <a href="/wiki/Linebacker" title="Linebacker">linebackers</a>, 2 <a href="/wiki/Cornerback" title="Cornerback">cornerbacks</a>, and 1 <a href="/wiki/Safety_(American_football_position)" class="mw-redirect" title="Safety (American football position)">safety</a>.
</p><p>The field is 50-yard between end zones, 30 yards wide, and the end zones are 8 yards deep.<sup id="cite_ref-News14_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-News14-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>A game consists of four 10-minute periods, separated by a 12-minute halftime (30-minute halftime in championship). In the event of a tie, an 8-minute sudden-death overtime is played; whoever scores first wins it; otherwise, the game ends drawn &amp; teams get a tie (half-victory/half-loss) in standings; however, in postseason, multiple 10-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores, which wins the game. Teams get 2 timeouts per half or overtime period.
</p><p>Targeting players, such as using the helmet to ram opponents, is prohibited; they risk immediate disqualification plus a 15-yard penalty if they do.
</p><p>As in the NFL, injuries in last two minutes of half or overtime result in the team using a timeout; if, however the team has no timeouts, and this occurs, they're granted one.
