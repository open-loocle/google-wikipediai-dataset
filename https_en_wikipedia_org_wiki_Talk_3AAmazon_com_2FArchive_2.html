<ul><li><b>Oppose</b> - The company name is Amazon.com, with the full official name being "Amazon.com, Inc." Even on the other websites for the company (such as the .co.uk page mentioned above), the copyright at the bottom of the page states "<i>© 1996-2014, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates</i>" Per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>, it is quite reasonable to shorten this to simply Amazon.com as the article is currently named. --- <a href="/wiki/User:Barek" title="User:Barek">Barek</a> <small>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Barek" title="User talk:Barek">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barek" title="Special:Contributions/Barek">contribs</a>)</small> - 16:17, 31 March 2014 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>ok but this article only talks about the products in the us and only says it is other continents but does not tell you about amazon global nor products in others countries by amazon so I think we should change the name so that it talks about it in other country's and other domains. Or we can create different article for each continent like <a href="/w/index.php?title=Amazon_europe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amazon europe (page does not exist)">Amazon europe</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Amazon_africa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amazon africa (page does not exist)">Amazon africa</a>. There is anyways a lot of information so adding othere informations for other country's would make the article too big so I think some section should be moved into its own article. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/94.197.122.75" title="Special:Contributions/94.197.122.75">94.197.122.75</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:94.197.122.75" title="User talk:94.197.122.75">talk</a>) 16:54, 31 March 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Support</b> Most people do refer to Amazon.com as simply Amazon anymore (and even more probably forgot about the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">South American river</a> altogether at this point), and they have expanded beyond e-commerce. The ".com" isn't necessary. <a href="/wiki/User:Jgera5" title="User:Jgera5">Jgera5</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jgera5" title="User talk:Jgera5">talk</a>) 05:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. The name of the parent company is Amazon.com, and as mentioned by <a href="/wiki/User:Barek" title="User:Barek">Barek</a> Amazon UK lists Amazon.com in it's legal disclaimer at the foot of the page. I do think the page could be improved by adding more information on non-US operations, but the title is correct as it is. <a href="/wiki/User:Zarcadia" title="User:Zarcadia">Zarcadia</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zarcadia" title="User talk:Zarcadia">talk</a>) 12:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Support.</b> This is a case of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UCN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UCN">WP:UCN</a>. Looking at news articles, books, and the like, I see them use "Amazon" instead of "Amazon.com" to refer to the company. —<a href="/wiki/User:Seav" title="User:Seav">seav</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Seav" title="User talk:Seav">talk</a>) 20:32, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NCDAB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NCDAB">natural disambiguation</a> title of "Amazon.com" is shorter, and therefore more preferable to me, than the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NCDAB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NCDAB">parenthetical disambiguation</a> title of "Amazon (company)".</li>
<li><b>Support</b>. May be commonly called "Amazon.com" in the USA, but it certainly isn't in the UK, where it is commonly just called "Amazon".

<dl><dd>Amazon also employs the use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years. The resulting damage to a supply and demand marketplace remains to be seen but advertising contracts with large search engines eliminating smaller websites from overall exposure these practices should have a negative effect on the industry on the whole.</dd></dl>

The result of the proposal was <b>closed</b> <p>
I would suggest moving the article to Amazon (online retailer) to represent a worldwide view on the topic. Also I have noticed that Amazon have dropped the .com suffix in their logo on their American website and refer to themselves as Amazon on information pages e.g. Amazon and Our Planet. Within the English Speaking World Amazon also trades in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. On those websites Amazon uses the local web suffix in the logos. I do not know what Canadians or Australians call it but in the UK most people just call it Amazon. I remember Americans calling it Amazon.com but in a video about the Kindle a US commentator said he was asked if it was that Amazon thing. That might suggest that at least some Americans moved on but I cannot be absolutely sure. <a href="/wiki/User:Tk420" title="User:Tk420">Tk420</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tk420" title="User talk:Tk420">talk</a>) 20:20, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

<h2><span id="What_IS_Amazon.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="What_IS_Amazon?">What IS Amazon?</span></h2>
<p>The introduction of the article presents many terms (even linking to <a href="/wiki/Bookstore" class="mw-redirect" title="Bookstore">bookstore</a>!) but not a simple explanation of what Amazon actually does/is.  It is clear they provide a retail service (a service to members of the public, a final service for VAT purposes) but I image they provide services for others too.  The question surely is whether or not the public is the primary customer and profit centre for Amazon?  Comparing Amazon with a bookstore:- does Amazon keep repositories of inventory in expectation of a demand i.e does Amazon take the risk of creating and storing inventory?   Or is Amazon an intermediary or broker, providing an order fulfilment service (like that I imagine it's founder provided or was vary familiar with from his previous life)?  Buying books through Amazon for instance, the postage costs are dictated by Amazon not by the "real retailers" i.e the people who send the invoice, pack the product, etc.  The delivery aspect of Amazon's business may well be the most profitable part of it not the actual retailing of the product.  Using the term retailer or online retailer for Amazon seems to extend the definitions to the point of meaninglessness and this is the reason the introduction ends up being so anaemic.  It contains no more than a superficial description of what is evident from a single glance at Amazon's home page.  It seems to me that Amazon is actually a logistics company providing a seamless producer-customer service/channel.  It takes orders for their retailer clients directly from customers and I imagine their profit comes not from the sale of the goods themselves (if they did then all orders would be fulfilled with invoices from Amazon) but from transaction fees of various sorts charged at different points in the order-life of the goods they transport.  <a href="/wiki/User:LookingGlass" title="User:LookingGlass">LookingGlass</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:LookingGlass" title="User talk:LookingGlass">talk</a>) 13:19, 20 December 2015 (UTC)

<p>Hello,
</p><p>Net income is currently listed as "US$ 241 million (2014)" with a red arrow signifying a decrease from the prior period. If you follow the citation (number 7 on the page), Amazon actually had a net loss of US$ 241 for the year. This is a decrease from the past year (net income of 274 in 2013), so the red arrow is still appropriate. The line should be updated to "US$ -241 million (2014)", which follows other examples of listing a net loss with a negative sign.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subsidiaries_sections_organization_and_redundancy">Subsidiaries sections organization and redundancy</span></h2>
<p><b>The Problem:</b> There is a main Subsidiaries section and a subsection of Aquisitions with some overlapping and disjoint information. It seems the subsection lists 2004 and 2007 acquisitions that have been maintained as subsidiaries and mentions the existence of over 40 others naming some most of which are listed by year above Acquisitions. <b>Suggestion:</b> It seems like it would make more sense to include these in the appropriate year and note (for them and those already listed by year) somehow that they remain operated as subsidiaries based on the current organization of that whole section. <b>Further problem:</b> The lower down main section named Subsidiaries then relists a handful of these same sites with blurbs, all but one of those listed in addition to being listed above, have their own main article. It seems like it is redundant if links to the appropriate company pages are included for subsidiaries notable enough to have one in the A&amp;I section, particularly if they can be clearly distinguished from other acquisitions as subsidiaries. <b>Suggestion:</b> This suggestion is definitely more significant and therefore probably requires more consensus, maybe it should be removed as redundant after sufficient improvements are made to the Aquisitions section? 
</p><p>Thoughts, opinions anyone? Having raised these thoughts and being unsure of the best way to proceed I'll leave it to others to make the changes if they see the best way to proceed.

<p>Hello,
</p><p>I am an employee of Brilliance Publishing, attempting to start a social media initiative with our company. We are trying to beef up our online presence and insure that the information on our page is up-to-date (some of the info about Brilliance Publishing is incorrect). 
</p><p>We understand it is a conflict of interest to attempt to update our own information, but we would like to see Brilliance Publishing have its own page as a subsidiary of Amazon (Tantor Media is a subsidiary of Recorded Books, for example, and Tantor has their own page). Is it possible to get a Brilliance Publishing page created?
</p><p>What can we do to get you the information you need to update this page? We know that that our source has to be reliable and that it can't be a company-based source. Do newspaper articles, public awards, and other websites count as reliable sources?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="More_info_on_Amazon_recommendation_algorithms">More info on Amazon recommendation algorithms</span></h2>
<p>Hello folks. 
</p><p>I am an Amazon employee, and I worked on several of its recommender systems.
</p><p>Amazon recently decided to publish some of these algorithms. I happen to be author on two of these papers.
</p><p>The article mentions "The company also records data on customer buyer behavior which enables them to offer or recommend to an individual specific item, or bundles of items based upon preferences demonstrated through purchases or items visited", and cites a webpage that speculates on how amazon recommendation works.
</p><p>I think there is value in additionally citing proper scientific papers, released by amazon itself, about how their algorithms work.
</p><p>The two publications are:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Amazon_in_Ireland">Amazon in Ireland</span></h2>
<p>Currently the Wikipedia page says "Amazon has separate retail websites for the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, France, [and so on]". I think the "United Kingdom and Ireland" part is misleading. This is because Amazon's UK site (Amazon.co.uk) isn't linked to Ireland. This means if you live in Ireland (like me), buying things from Amazon.co.uk can be a real pain. Sometimes sellers on Amazon.co.uk won't ship certain items to Ireland (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056774377">http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056774377</a> for example). When this happens, we have to use a third-party service like Parcelmotel or Addresspal to bring items over here. Even when sellers do ship items to Ireland, the postage is usually more expensive than delivery to the UK.  Furthermore, a UK Amazon Prime account doesn't cover free postage to Ireland. So essentially, Amazon.co.uk is not linked to Ireland in any special way. So I think we should remove Ireland from the sentence altogether. The sentence should just say, "Amazon has separate retail websites for the United States, the United Kingdom, France, [and so on]".  <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:Paul_P" title="User:Paul P">Paul P</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Paul_P#top" title="User talk:Paul P">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Paul_P" title="Special:Contributions/Paul P">contribs</a>) 10:08, 30 May 2017 (UTC)</small>

Today, Amazon encompasses a variety of products made by Amazon themselves, putting them on par with companies like Apple and Google and becoming more than just that online retailer we all knew in the 1990s and 2000s. I realize I put "online retailer" in parentheses, but I cannot think of a better description to put in there; please comment if you think something else should be in the parentheses.

It doesn't make a huge amount of difference, but many people prefer natural disambiguation when available, per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NCDAB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NCDAB">WP:NCDAB</a>. In addition, four of the websites cited are in foreign languages, which we normally don't consider on English WP. And technically speaking, the UK web site is of an affiliate; it states "The Amazon.co.uk website ... is part of the Amazon group and is ultimately owned by Amazon.com, Inc., ... The Amazon.co.uk website is operated by Amazon EU Sarl, a Luxembourg-based entity".

It ought to be obvious that the sensible name is the actual name of the company, which is what the article is titled at present.

Let me take you through what <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">COMMONNAME</a> actually says:</dd>
<dd><i>"A good Wikipedia article title has the five following characteristics:"</i></dd>
<dd><i>"<b>Recognizability</b> – The title is a name or description of the subject that someone familiar with, although not necessarily an expert in, the subject area will recognize."</i>  "Amazon.com" clearly fits that description perfectly.</dd>
<dd><i>"<b>Naturalness</b> – The title is one that readers are likely to look or search for and that editors would naturally use to link to the article from other articles. Such a title usually conveys what the subject is actually called in English."</i>  There is no dispute that "Amazon" is a natural title, but as it is unavailable, then that is a moot point!  What matters is that there is nothing "unnatural" about the actual name of the company.</dd>
<dd><i>"<b>Precision</b> – The title unambiguously identifies the article's subject and distinguishes it from other subjects."</i> "Amazon.com" meets that criterion exactly.  "Amazon (company)" does not. (There are many Amazon companies, quite a few of which have articles about them on WP.)</dd>
<dd><i>"<b>Conciseness</b> – The title is no longer than necessary to identify the article's subject and distinguish it from other subjects."</i>  There have been NO suggestions of titles which are shorter than "Amazon.com".</dd>
<dd><i>"<b>Consistency</b> – The title is consistent with the pattern of similar articles' titles."</i> "Amazon.com" is fully consistent with other titles of articles which are about campanies with ".com" as part of their name, a few examples: <a href="/wiki/Ancestry.com" title="Ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/JD.com" title="JD.com">JD.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/ASOS.com" class="mw-redirect" title="ASOS.com">ASOS.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salesforce.com" class="mw-redirect" title="Salesforce.com">salesforce.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lastminute.com" title="Lastminute.com">lastminute.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Booking.com" title="Booking.com">Booking.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hotels.com" title="Hotels.com">Hotels.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Priceline.com" title="Priceline.com">Priceline.com</a></dd>
<dd><i>"These should be seen as goals, not as rules. For most topics, there is a simple and obvious title that meets these goals satisfactorily. If so, use it as a straightforward choice."</i>  That <i><b>"simple and obvious title"</b></i> is the one already in use.  <a href="/wiki/User:FF-UK" title="User:FF-UK">FF-UK</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FF-UK" title="User talk:FF-UK">talk</a>) 12:02, 7 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>FF-UK: I understand you feel strongly on this matter, but others are not being "dishonest" or "ridiculous" to propose and fairly consider alternatives to your preferred title.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">Please assume good faith</a> and be polite to your fellow editors.</dd>
<dd>As to COMMONNAME, nearly all its listed goals support a parenthetical title like "Amazon (company)" as well or better than "Amazon.com":
<ul><li><b>Recognizable</b> — Yes, arguably more so than Amazon.com, based on usage in reliable sources.</li>
<li><b>Natural</b> — Yes, again more so than Amazon.com per reliable sources.</li>
<li><b>Precise</b> — Yes: the title makes it clear that the article encompasses the whole company; the current URL-based name might inappropriately suggest it's about only the website or operations related to it.</li>

<dd>Your comment "the current URL-based name might inappropriately suggest it's about only the website" is a very obvious distortion, the current title of the article is <b>the actual name of the company</b>, suggesting that it just refers to the URL is deliberately misleading on your part!</dd>

<dd>As for the conciseness criterion, yes: it says that it shouldn't be longer than necessary to identify the article's subject, but that identification must at the same time be clear.  Given that the subject is all of Amazon, the title "Amazon.com" has at the potential to be problematic — particularly since (as others have noted) people in the UK and elsewhere don't even know the <i>website</i> as amazon.com (but rather as amazon.co.uk). <a href="/wiki/User:Huwmanbeing" title="User:Huwmanbeing">╠╣uw</a>&#160;<span style="font-size:smaller">[<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huwmanbeing" title="User talk:Huwmanbeing">talk</a>]</span> 10:17, 8 September 2017 (UTC)

I have never disputed that "Amazon" is a common name for the company, but it is not available, so no point in going on about it!  Likewise, referring to the website URL is also just disinformation, the article is not named for the US website.  It is named after the subject of the article, a  company called "Amazon.com" (that is the WHOLE company, not just some part of it).  As a UK citizen, I have no difficulty at all recognizing that simple fact, and the WP article title cannot be expected to cater for the ignorance of a few folk who are unaware that there is more to Amazon than a shopping website in their own home country.  The article actually does a pretty good job of explaining what Amazon.com consists of, that is its job, it is not enough to just read a title and expect to understand the entire subject!

The fact that "Amazon (company)" or "Amazon (online retailer)" are also not the common names is mostly irrelevant, because parenthetical titles are used in Wikipedia for <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PARENDIS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PARENDIS">disambiguation</a> and the parts in parentheses are <i>never</i> really intended as part of the common name. "Amazon.com" could be a suitable natural disambiguation in the United States, perhaps, where "Amazon.com", while not common as "Amazon", may plausibly not be uncommon, but the fact that it's unheard of in Europe just rules it out as a good <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WORLDWIDE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WORLDWIDE">worldwide</a> candidate. <a href="/wiki/User:LjL" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:LjL" title="User talk:LjL">talk</a>) 01:41, 5 September 2017 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I have provided a number of "facts", largely involving Wikipedia guidelines on names and how they apply to Amazon. What you seem to be doing above is basically shouting at me, so maybe, don't. To reiterate: the legal name of the company almost approaches irrelevance if it's not the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> for most people, and one <i>seriously really tiny</i> mention that the page is "© 2010-2017, Amazon.com, Inc." at the very bottom of EU pages definitely doesn't change that fact int the least. <a href="/wiki/User:LjL" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:LjL" title="User talk:LjL">talk</a>) 20:30, 5 September 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I think possibly you're missing the point that we use common names in article titles and if common names are ambiguous then we use parenthetical disambiguation. Maybe you don't agree with this, but it's been Wikipedia practice for many years. No reason to make an exception here. The fact the company uses it is irrelevant. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OFFICIAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OFFICIAL">WP:OFFICIAL</a>. It's what people <i>commonly</i> call it that's relevant. And, given it's a global business, that's people all over the world, not just in America. And take a look at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">British website</a>. Where does it say Amazon.com? Everywhere it just calls itself Amazon. Oh look, that's the same on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.amazon.com/">American website</a>. Amazon, not Amazon.com (the latter only in the URL).

<dl><dd>I think that it is you who is missing the point and suggest that you check the facts!  A google search for the SPECIFIC term "amazon.com" returns over 530 million results, a google search for pages on which both "amazon" and "retail" appear returns only 64 million.

<dd>FF-UK: When there's a parenthetical addition to one of our titles, that doesn't mean that people in common usage refer to the subject that way.  It's <i>Wikipedia's</i> clarifier, used to distinguish between otherwise identically-named subjects.  For example, our article on English poet John Smith is sensibly titled "<a href="/wiki/John_Smith_(English_poet)" title="John Smith (English poet)">John Smith (English poet)</a>", a title that makes it clear that the man was known as John Smith, and that he was the John Smith who was an English poet.<br />The same goes for "Amazon (online retailer)": it correctly conveys that the subject is commonly known as Amazon, and that among our many Amazon articles it's the one about the online retailer.  Like the nominator, I'm fine considering better alternatives if anyone has any they prefer.  Perhaps just "retailer" would suffice, given that they now operate a handful of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-targets-the-convenient-store-with-new-instant-pickup-locations/">brick-and-mortar locations</a>...  <a href="/wiki/User:Huwmanbeing" title="User:Huwmanbeing">╠╣uw</a>&#160;<span style="font-size:smaller">[<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huwmanbeing" title="User talk:Huwmanbeing">talk</a>]</span> 18:10, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>User:Huwmanbeing|╠╣uw - That does not alter the fact that 530 million page references on google provides more than ample evidence that "amazon.com" is very very common!

<dl><dd>But how many of those pages simply include links to the website at "amazon.com"?  We can't assume that every appearance of the URL counts as the company being referred to primarily as "Amazon.com".  (For instance:<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/amazons-private-label-business-is-booming-thanks-to-device-sales-expanded-fashion-lines/">[13]</a>,<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4099548-amazon-earnings-holy-grail">[14]</a>, etc.)  <a href="/wiki/User:Huwmanbeing" title="User:Huwmanbeing">╠╣uw</a>&#160;<span style="font-size:smaller">[<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huwmanbeing" title="User talk:Huwmanbeing">talk</a>]</span> 09:03, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>So you don't think that the online retailing business is the main or best-known business of the company? Or that it (and the rest of the business) is commonly known simply as Amazon? Or that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>, a fundamental pillar of Wikipedia, should apply in this instance? Really?

<dl><dd>Of course I think that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> should apply, but that does not alter the fact that, as there are many valid uses of the name "Amazon", and the subject of this article is most certainly NOT the primary use, then "Amazon" is not an available title for this article. Therefore we need disambiguation.  Natural disambiguation <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NATURALDIS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NATURALDIS">WP:NATURALDIS</a> is the appropriate method, and the policy requires <i>"Using an alternative name that the subject is also commonly called in English reliable sources, albeit not as commonly as the preferred-but-ambiguous title."</i>  The formal name "Amazon.com" is not only fully explicit, as it contains the simple term "Amazon", but is also in common use, and thus complies fully with the policy.  <a href="/wiki/User:FF-UK" title="User:FF-UK">FF-UK</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FF-UK" title="User talk:FF-UK">talk</a>) 13:01, 18 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Comment</b> There is a lot of emphasis on retail in this discussion, but I urge editors to note that cloud computing is an increasing part of Amazon.com's total business, representing 10% of Amazon.com sales in the first half of the current year, but 110% of the operating profit in the same period! In other words, Amazon.com would have been a lossmaking corporation were it not for cloud computing. (Also consider the B2B and hardware manufacturing businesses which do not count as retail.)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Good point. We could probably go for "<a href="/wiki/Amazon_(company)" title="Amazon (company)">Amazon (company)</a>" instead, but that should be raised in a separate move request.

<dl><dd>See my point above. "(online retailer)" is just not the proper disamibugation, and "(company)" would be far more preferable, however, it comes that ".com" is a far more handy <i>natural</i> disasmbiguator, which is far superior to a standard disambiguator (see my examples above). <a href="/wiki/User:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lordtobi"><span style="font-family: Impact;">Lordtobi</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Lordtobi"><span style="color: #B0B0B0;">&#9993;</span></a>) 15:16, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Comment</b> I continue to be amazed by the number of editors who are stating an opinion, but seem unaware that the actual name of the company we are discussing is NOT "Amazon", it is in fact <b>"Amazon.com"!</b>  Changing away from that is not going to make it any easier for WP users to find the article, if they type Amazon they will still reach the disambiguation page.  As things stand, if anyone searches WP for <a href="/wiki/Amazon_(company)" title="Amazon (company)">Amazon (company)</a>  or <a href="/wiki/Amazon_(retailer)" class="mw-redirect" title="Amazon (retailer)">Amazon (retailer)</a> or <a href="/wiki/Amazon.co.uk" class="mw-redirect" title="Amazon.co.uk">Amazon.co.uk</a> they will still be taken directly to the Amazon.com page.  I have yet to see a logical argument which would support the idea that one of these parenthetical disambiguator names, none of which represent what people actually call the company, is better than the real name.  <a href="/wiki/User:FF-UK" title="User:FF-UK">FF-UK</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FF-UK" title="User talk:FF-UK">talk</a>) 09:23, 22 August 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ah so you refer to the company as 'Amazon.com' when discussing it in conversation with peers? I, and most others it seems, refer to it as Amazon and all seem to understand perfectly well what we're talking about without using its domain name. The use of parenthesis in the article title clearly isn't what people use when referring to the company, hence why it is in parenthesis. The company is referred to as Amazon, and therefore I feel that's how it should be referred to on Wikipedia, with suitable parenthesis for disambiguation as is used on many articles. I don't think anyone here is disputing the actual company name, it is obviously Amazon.com, I think the dispute lies in how it is and should be referred, an important difference. <a href="/wiki/User:TGB13" title="User:TGB13">TGB13</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TGB13" title="User talk:TGB13">talk</a>) 20:43, 27 August 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It seems that the point is that, either way we put it, the Wikipedia article title will not exactly line up with common name, as the common name page <a href="/wiki/Amazon" class="mw-disambig" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> is <i>taken</i>. I sure think you wouldn't go up to your friend and say "Hey, what do you think about the Amazon (company) Echo"? Yes, "Amazon.com Echo" is just as incorrect, but the point FF-UK is trying to deliver is that the .com appendix far simplifies the disambiguation process, as it is part of "Amazon.com, Inc." <i>company name</i>. I have given enough reason and examples above with moving this page from one (natural) disambiguator to another (parenthetical) is useless, and actually a bad decision. Think this way: Everyone wanting to find out about the company will either type in "Amazon", "Amazon.com" or "Amazon.[their respective TLD]", all the ones that get the first result will find the river, go for disambiguation, and then land here, while all others will be redirected here. Moving the page would merged option two with option three, as such cause more server traffic (minor, but still), and not help anybody. <i>No one</i> would type out "Amazon (company)" when looking for the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lordtobi"><span style="font-family: Impact;">Lordtobi</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Lordtobi"><span style="color: #B0B0B0;">&#9993;</span></a>) 20:59, 27 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I don't think anyone is doubting the ability to navigate to the page, if they are I feel they are missing the point. For me it is a matter of the company being more than Amazon.com, it is Amazon.co.uk etc., its cloud services, Prime, music, film, tv. You are correct, no one refers to it as 'Amazon (company)', but that isn't how parenthesis is used, it is there if it is needed. If someone spoke about 'amazon' you would say 'Which amazon? The river or the company?', this will be what the parenthesis is used for. The common name for the company is most definitely 'Amazon' and not 'Amazon.com', that needs to be reflected on the article in my opinion. The debate isn't about how people are going to find the page, that's been made very simple with lots of redirecting, it's more the fact that some people feel the article title should reflect it's common name, and the parenthesis is there if required. Parenthesis are there as and when required, that's all it would be used for here. The same as the Amazon river article could easily be titled 'Amazon (river)'. <a href="/wiki/User:TGB13" title="User:TGB13">TGB13</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TGB13" title="User talk:TGB13">talk</a>) 21:24, 27 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li><b>Comment</b> Will editors please concentrate on FACTS rather than misinformed opinions!</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There is a page titled <a href="/wiki/Amazon" class="mw-disambig" title="Amazon">Amazon</a>, it is a disambiguation page which lists no fewer than <b>67 pages</b> dealing with subjects related to the word "Amazon".  Amazon is NOT available as the title of a particular article, and is NOT in use for the article on the river as some people seem to believe, that article is <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a>.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The page <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com" class="mw-redirect" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> starts with the words: <i>"<b>Amazon.com, Inc.</b>, also known as simply <b>Amazon</b></i>.  There can be no possible confusion as to what the page is about, therefore there is NO logical reason to change it.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>It is completely normal for the WP articles about major corporations to have the company's formal name as the article title, sometimes followed by a "commonly known as" comment in the first part of the lede.  Some examples:</dd>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Group" title="Volkswagen Group">Volkswagen Group</a> - but we refer to them simply as VW.</dd>

Amazon.com Inc. IS the name of the public corporation, all other businesses and companies in the Amazon group are subsidiary to Amazon.com.  Clearly an article titled <b>Amazon (online retailer)</b> would exclude many parts of Amazon.com, as would <b>Amazon (retailer)</b>.  An article entitled <b>Amazon (company)</b> would not indicate WHICH of the many Amazon companies it was about!  (Bear in mind that there are already many other articles which deal with specific parts of the Amazon empire).  Those that prefer the "company" disambiguator should bear in mind that it would only be a reasonable and accurate title if it were <b>Amazon.com (company)</b>, but that would also be an entirely pointless exercise.

<dl><dd>There's no point in continuing this discussion when valid points are ignored and instead certain points are cherry picked to be pulled apart. No one is 'confused', we all know what the article starts with, we all know the actual name of the company, we all know we can just type in near enough anything into the search page and we will be redirected to the page. But again these points continue to be used and valid points are ignored. It is merely a case of using the company's common name rather than official name, which in fact, is preferred by Wikipedia: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_titles#Use_commonly_recognizable_names" title="Wikipedia:Article titles">Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names</a>. Which also gives many examples of articles named after their common names rather than their official names, to balance your examples of formal names over common names. Nevertheless, the point about the differences between Amazon as a company and its various subsidiaries is probably the most important here, and that's where I feel my opinion has changed, so I present the following compromise: would it make sense to follow the system used for <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alphabet_Inc." title="Alphabet Inc.">Alphabet Inc.</a> on Wikipedia? So 'Amazon.com, Inc.' would be the equivalent of 'Alphabet' and therefore describing the parent company, then create a page to describe the online retail subsidiary in the same way other subsidiaries have their own pages such as <a href="/wiki/Amazon_Echo" title="Amazon Echo">Amazon Echo</a> etc. It does feel strange that Amazon Echo has its own page, yet Amazon online retail doesn't and is instead combined in the parent company page. That system has worked successfully for Google's evolution, I feel it would work well for Amazon's too. <a href="/wiki/User:TGB13" title="User:TGB13">TGB13</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TGB13" title="User talk:TGB13">talk</a>) 16:05, 28 August 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bottomline">Bottomline</span></h3>
<p>Since this discussion is getting out of hand, I would like to summarize the following key points which sould be regarded for this discussion:
</p>
<ul><li>This discussion focuses on the proposed move to "Amazon (online retailer)", not "Amazon (company)" or anything similar. From my comments above, you should know that Amazon has more business than just online retail (such as operating AWS, developing and producing Echo/Alexa, providing music and video streaming services, printing books and serving as book publishing service, digital games market, etc., etc.), wherefore company would be a better parenthetical disambiguator, if one had to be chosen. However, if you prefer the "not 'online retailer'" option, you should keep in mind that this discussion focuses on 'online retailer' and as such you should oppose this proposal and wait for a discussion on "Amazon (company)" that will likely follow up once this discussion is closed.</li>
<li>Fact is: the company's legal name is <b>Amazon.com, Inc.</b>, however fact is also that the common name for the company is simply <b>Amazon</b>, this pointed out in the lead and should, from my knowledge, be common consensus, regardless of region and respective top-level domain. I doubt that anyone, neither British, nor American, nor German, usually refers to the company by "Amazon.com" or its full, legal name. <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:FF-UK" title="User:FF-UK">FF-UK</a>:</span> It appears that the legal name is your primary argument, and I agree that it plays a role, but it should not go against <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> in te way you put it.</li>
<li>The problem: The page <a href="/wiki/Amazon" class="mw-disambig" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> is already occupied (I would have said by the river, but I were corrected and have cecked since that it is actually a disambiguation page). This means that we have to decide <b>between a <i>natural</i> disambiguator and a <i>parenthetical</i> disambiguator</b>. Both actually have about the same effect, the only difference is that a forced piped link could be avoided with a natural disambiguator: See that, from every page where you wish to link this page, you could either simply say <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com" class="mw-redirect" title="Amazon.com">[[Amazon.com]]</a> or have to pipe out <a href="/wiki/Amazon_(company)" title="Amazon (company)">[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]</a> (if you prefer only Amazon to be displayed, <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com" class="mw-redirect" title="Amazon.com">[[Amazon.com|Amazon]]</a> can still be used can still be used, even if this page retains its natural disambiguator. There is nothing wrong with either solution, but obviously I prefer the prior case, as it is cleaner in code and it is <i>not wrong</i> (some say that Amazon.com is wrong, but it is not, trust me), but obviously consensus will decide on which to use.</li>
<li>Bottomline of my bottomline: Please <b>discuss wether to use a legitimate natural disambiguator (.com) or an unfavored parenthetical disambiguator (online retailer)</b>! If this discussion fails you can still discuss if you wish to a legit parenthetical disambiguator (company) <i>later on</i>. <a href="/wiki/User:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lordtobi"><span style="font-family: Impact;">Lordtobi</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Lordtobi"><span style="color: #B0B0B0;">&#9993;</span></a>) 18:47, 7 September 2017 (UTC)

As stated in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NCDAB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NCDAB">WP:NCDAB</a> <i>"<b>Natural disambiguation is generally preferable to parenthetical disambiguation</b>"</i>.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> also tells us that <i>"Other encyclopedias are among the sources that may be helpful in deciding what titles are in an encyclopedic register, as well as what names are most frequently used"</i>, so please consider that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amazoncom">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/amazoncom">Encyclopedia.com</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095407782">Oxford Reference</a> all use "Amazon.com" as the title of their respective entries.  It is also worth remembering that the company has been called "Amazon.com" since it first went online in 1995, and the title of this article has always been "Amazon.com" since the article was created in September 2002, 15 years ago this month.  <a href="/wiki/User:FF-UK" title="User:FF-UK">FF-UK</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FF-UK" title="User talk:FF-UK">talk</a>) 19:39, 7 September 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>See that I don't actually disagree with you; yes, Amazon.com is correct and well enough to use naturally disambiguated, but keep in mind that other encyclopedias are just "<i>among</i> the sources that may be helpful" (as you quoted from COMMONNAME), not the defining opinions (they are also usually edited by professionals who don't usually go by popular opinion, unlike Wikipedia). You and I cannot deny that "Amazon" is more frequent than "Amazon.com" in reliable sources and among the masses (the company's own pages and logo also just use "Amazon", except for the copyright claim, which incorporates the legal name), and as such <i>would</i> apply to COMMONNAME. But since COMMONNAME would lead to a parenthetical disambiguator, NCDAB gives use the choice between a natural and a parenthetical disambiguator, although the prior is preferred by NCDAB, it forces neither. Yes, Amazon.com is the nicer way to go, but in the end, the consensus (which should be reached with this discussion) will decide. The back-and-forth, what is correct and what is not, is nonsensial, as both versions are correct, one is <i>preferred</i> but not enforced by Wikipedia, but consensus should always have the last word. <a href="/wiki/User:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lordtobi"><span style="font-family: Impact;">Lordtobi</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lordtobi" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Lordtobi"><span style="color: #B0B0B0;">&#9993;</span></a>) 20:14, 7 September 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li></ul>
