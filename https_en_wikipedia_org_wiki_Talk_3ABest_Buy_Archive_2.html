<p>There needs to be a set of critera established for that should be posted in the Criticisms section.  If having a criticisms section is going to allow for endless postings of every lawsuit filed against the Best Buy company, then I just as soon see the section go away.  The truth of the matter is, is that Best Buy probably has hundreds of lawsuits filed against them every year.  But I don't believe that the scope of wikipedia, is to provide an account of every single lawsuit that's filed against them.  So what are some ideas for guidelines that need to be met in order to post something in that Criticisms section?  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 21:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>we can just debate each one to see which ones are worthy... I think court cases are much more relevant to the article than a "no-christmas" policy.. It's going to be nearly impossible to create a set of criteria that is fair. There's only one court case in the section, so I don't see how it is a problem. I'd say its relevant because it involves multiple stores, is a federal case, and has been brought to the court by a state. Future/past similar cases can simply be combined into the same sentence (rather than having multiple sections/paragraphs for it) <a href="/wiki/User:Bgold4" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 21:50, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Try <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Criticism" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a> for ideas.  If it's a major lawsuit then I usually put it in its own article and provide a link to it from both the defendant's page and the prosecutor's page (when applicable).  As far as the Christmas thing, content like that should go in the article about the organization criticizing Best Buy, not the article about Best Buy itself.  Regards, <a href="/wiki/User:Tuxide" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 22:47, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I agree with both of you.  I think the no-christmas policy is not relevant enough for the article.  Things like the PS3 and XBOX fiascos could probably be crafted into one short sentence with citations.  I'm going to see how creative I can be and write those two into one paragraph.  And I think we do away with the no-christmas policy.  The truth of the matter is that if it was ever relevant, it's relevant only for this Christmas season.  After that, it's pretty much irrelevant on all fronts.  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 23:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Sounds good... I'm looking forward to seeing it. Let me know if you want any help <a href="/wiki/User:Bgold4" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 23:09, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay, I did it.  I hope there's not too much flack.  Basically, summarized the XBOX and Playstation incidents.  If the reader wants more detail about the incidents, the links to the sources are included.  It's not necessary for us to include all the nitty gritty details if it's available via the link.  Secondly, removed the no-christmas policy altogether as discussed above.  Lastly, removed the paragraph regarding the civil suit in Wisconsin.  It's a pending lawsuit, so I don't see it as having any relevance to the article.  If Best Buy is found at fault in the end, then that might be another matter to discuss later.  Until then, I don't see how it adds anything to the article.  Thoughts?  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 09:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Well I disagree and out of respect for all those who actually contributed and edited this section I reinstated it.
</p><p>It might be prudent to actually ask those who contributed to this page about drastic changes befroe making them unilaterally. Happy Holidays! <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Jomomm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jomomm (page does not exist)">Jomomm</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jomomm&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jomomm (page does not exist)">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jomomm" title="Special:Contributions/Jomomm">contribs</a>) </span></small>
</p><p>Jomomm, that is actually the intention of this discussion page.  I have no way of contacting every single person that contributes to this page.  That is what the talk page is for.  And the reason I went ahead with the change, was because all I had seen was positive responses to my ideas and that was why I went ahead with them. <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 02:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
</p><p>I'd say to combine the PS3 + 360 paragraphs into one paragraph, get rid of the no christmas paragraph, and leave the Wisconsin trial... I'd also say that the trial magazine paragraph should be eliminated (I think that has to do with a third party rather than Best Buy) <a href="/wiki/User:Bgold4" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 02:46, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The trial magazine thing has been going on for a long time, and yes, it has to do with a third party.  Not Best Buy themselves.  There have been numerous news stories on this, and the end result always pointed to either the magazine company or the subscriber not reading all the terms and conditions of the trial subscription.  Back to the "no-christmas policy", I should reiterate that this is a short-term issue, and it really won't have any relevance after Christmas is over.  So I agree, it should go.  I did merge the XBOX and PS3 paragraphs already.  I also included a little more detail than I did on the last edit, in hopes that it will cause a little less "shock" to other editors.  I really think that if readers want more details than whats on the wikipedia page, then they can follow the links.  It's not necessary to copy down every little detail.  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 04:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Also, what could be done to keep people from adding the "no-christmas" content back in is to merge it into <a href="/wiki/Christmas_controversies" title="Christmas controversies">Christmas controversies</a> (if it isn't there already) and provide a link to it in Best Buy's See also section.  This is annoying me because "no-christmas" content seems to be prominent on many articles about retailers, despite that this is a single organization's cowboy crusade.  <a href="/wiki/User:Tuxide" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 07:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>It seems that there is a consensus here to not have it in this article... if someone wants to add it to <a href="/wiki/Christmas_controversies" title="Christmas controversies">Christmas controversies</a>, feel free to... although I personally wouldn't consider it anything close to a controversy or anything close to notable <a href="/wiki/User:Bgold4" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 16:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The proper article used to be called <a href="/wiki/Secularization_of_Christmas" class="mw-redirect" title="Secularization of Christmas">Secularization of Christmas</a>; however <a href="/wiki/Christmas_controversies" title="Christmas controversies">Christmas controversies</a> now contains such content because it was formed by merging Secularization of Christmas into another article that had to do with Christmas.  I have brought my issue up for discussion on <a href="/wiki/Talk:Christmas_controversies/Merge_proposal" title="Talk:Christmas controversies/Merge proposal">Talk:Christmas controversies/Merge proposal</a> because it seems to be quite an issue, so feel free to comment on it.  <a href="/wiki/User:Tuxide" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 03:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The biggest factor behind my reasons for not wanting it posted on the article, is because there is no fact-based sources for the information.  Yes, the general issue is that the words "Merry Christmas" were not used in the 2006 marketing campaign.  I don't recall even seeing the words "Happy Holidays" in the ads.  But the best source we have for that is the website of the boycotting organization?  That's a biased source, and shouldn't be relied upon as a reliable source.  That's my extra two cents on the matter. &#160;:)  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 02:51, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The first reference in the no-Christmas paragraph was an Associated Press article.  B2Bomber81's claim that "there is no fact-based sources for the information" seems to be untrue. (Posted by 148.87.1.172)
</p><p>First, please remember to sign your name on your posts.  Second, the link that you posted, claiming to be an Associate Press article is broken and doesn't work.  Besides, it appears its a forbes.com link anyway - not AP.  So, going back to what I said - there do not seem to be any fact-based sources out there.  The only working links anybody has posted are links to the AFA and Catholic League. I'm not saying that there is no fact to this story - I think it's well known to a lot of people.  But in order for the article to be valid, you have to have a credible source to cite.  AFA and Catholic League don't cut it for me. <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 14:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>(posted by 148.87.1.172) I'm sorry the original link is dead.  Fortunately, AP stories can be viewed on many different websites.  The no-Christmas story is still available on the MSNBC site: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15639425/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15639425/</a></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>You stated above: "The biggest factor behind my reasons for not wanting it posted on the article, is because there is no fact-based sources for the information."  The MSNBC link should remove your main objection.  Are there other objections?  You seem to be saying that that once "a consensus is reached", no new information can alter the final verdict.  I hope this is not the case.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl>
<p>I don't see why this needs to be posted on the article.  Why is it a criticism?  Wal-Mart decided to say "Merry Christmas", which is great - Best Buy opted to not refer to any one specific holiday on the chance that they would offend someone for not also saying Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, etc.  Now, that doesn't mean that Wal Mart did anything wrong by saying just Merry Christmas - I'm saying that I don't understand why just because some organization calls a boycott, why it automatically becomes a notable criticism?  I'm want to hear your thoughts on this.  Thanks.  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 17:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It is a criticism because of the simple fact that two national groups (AFA and Catholic League) have criticized Best Buy.  Whether the criticism is merited is outside the scope of Wikipedia.  Whether the criticism is "notable" is perhaps more subjective, but we could look at the media coverage.  The controversy has been featured on the Bill O'Reilly program (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612200012">http://mediamatters.org/items/200612200012</a> )  .  Also the email campaign against Best Buy is big enough to warrant a Snopes Urban Legends profile (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/christmas/bestbuy.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/christmas/bestbuy.asp</a> ).  This seems to be big enough of a controversy to be counted as "notable".  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There is discussion on <a href="/wiki/Talk:Christmas_controversies/Merge_proposal" title="Talk:Christmas controversies/Merge proposal">Talk:Christmas controversies/Merge proposal</a> concerning the inclusion of this topic; I encourage you to bring further discussion there.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You have two points listed on the other page.  One, the criticism is not retailer-specific.  Two, this is a single organization's "cowboy crusade."  Regarding the first point, it was Best Buy spokeswoman Dawn Bryant's statement that sparked the criticism.  All the subsequent criticism focused on BBY, and this particular statement.  Regarding the second point, there are three distinct critics of Best Buy: the AFA, the Catholic League, and Bill O'Reilly.  It's not just "a single organization".<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>The comment from Best Buy's spokeswoman didn't spark the controversy - AFA, CL and O'Reilly sparked the controversy when they chose to make an issue out of it.  I'm sorry, but just because those people have I'm sure if you dig a little deeper, you can probably find somebody making a stink about Wal-Mart or Target saying Merry Christmas too.  Do you think that should be posted on their articles as criticism as well?  I'd like you to take a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612010011">[1]</a> before you say anything else.  You'll see why I think that the whole "no-christmas" thing has been blown way out of proportion and shouldn't be included. <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 09:03, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I am aware of Media Matters and its stance on O'Reilly.  In an earlier post, I included a Media Matters link. You seem to be saying that critics are the cause of the controversy.  I think that a controversy requires at least two sides.  For example, is KFC or PETA the "spark" for the controversy between them?  For the sake of neutrality, I think the controversy should be mentioned in Wikipedia articles on both the source and target of the criticism. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay - but you keep using O'Reilly's involvement as a basis of truth to this and O'Reilly is the one that made up the story.  He made claims that Best Buy was firing employees for saying Merry Christmas, and Best Buy came out and said that wasn't true.  In the end, the only truth to this whole thing was that Best Buy stated they would only use Happy Holidays in their PRINTED advertisements.  They pointed out that the TV commercials even had representations of Christmas and never once uttered the words "Happy Holidays".  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 17:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>1. If you look at my posts, I have never linked O'Reilly's involvement to the truthfulness of the criticisms.  I only mentioned O'Reilly's coverage on this talk page to show that the controversy got enough media attention to be deemed <b>notable</b>, which was one of B2bomber81's criteria for putting a criticism in Wikipedia.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>2. There is no mention of O'Reilly's claims in the no-Christmas passage. I relied on the AP story for Dawn Bryant's statement, and the websites of the AFA and the Catholic League for their respective reactions.  Only these 3 sources were cited in the removed passage, included below for reference.    <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Best Buy made headlines in November 2006 when it announced that it would not use the word "Christmas" in its 2006 advertisements, bucking a retailing trend.

<dl><dd>Okay, I'm really tiring of this thread and it's obvious you aren't going to stop until this statement is posted.  I do find it interesting however, that you don't seem to be too involved in editing any other pages on Wikipedia.  I would also highly encourage you to begin reading &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; and learn how to do even some of the more simple things on Wikipedia - like learning how to properly sign your posts with your username.  I also recommend registering instead of editing anonymously.  You'll gain more respect that way.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I recommend that the following version be added to the article - no more, no less.  It states the facts, which are included in the AP article.  I don't see any need in linking to AFA, Catholic League or O'Reilly:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"In November 2006, Best Buy announced that it would continue to use "Happy Holidays" in its 2006 print advertisements. Dawn Bryant, a Best Buy spokeswoman, stated:  "We are going to continue to use the term <i>holiday</i> because there are several holidays throughout that time period, and we certainly need to be respectful of all of them."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>" Best Buy spokeswoman Dawn Bryant later clarified the statement saying "Best Buy employees are allowed to greet customers any way they choose, including 'Merry Christmas,' but the company's promotional efforts are limited."</dd>
<dd><a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 21:53, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>As stated in point 2 above, you'll see that O'Reilly was never part of the passage.  However, omitting the AFA and the Catholic League's opposition (backed by factual citations) means that no criticisms are actually mentioned.  The leftover result is just two decontexualized policy statements, which would be puzzling to the reader.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Well Wikipedia is built on consensus, so let's get some.  I agree with B2bomer81.  I don't really see why this is notable enough to be part of the article.  I'm sure many other companies made similar decisions with a wide range of responses.  You can't please everyone with this stuff and since it isn't really notable to Best Buy, I don't see why it should be in here at all.  The Christmas Controversies article would probably be appropriate to have it in there, as a minor note. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Paul_Cyr&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Paul Cyr (page does not exist)">Paul Cyr</a> 00:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Your objection that the no-Christmas policy isn't notable has already been rebutted above.  Bill O'Reilly's heavy coverage of Best Buy's no-Christmas policy (not just that of retailers in general) demonstrates that the controversy garners enough media attention.  As mentioned before, O'Reilly's coverage demonstrates notability (as opposed to accuracy), while the Associated Press article is used as an reliable source. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a> 13 February, 2007</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Surprisingly enough, not everyone considers everything that Bill O'Reilly talks about to be automatically notable.   (It's kind of funny that the link you found claims that he lied about the statements he made anyway...) Do you have any specific objections to the suggestion above about adding the <a href="/wiki/Christmas_controversy" class="mw-redirect" title="Christmas controversy">Christmas controversy</a> link to the See also section, and adding additional information there?  --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Onorem&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Onorem (page does not exist)">Onorem</a> 18:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>The O'Reilly source fails <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> for coming to a hypothesis that Best Buy has a no-christmas policy.  You have to see no further than the title of the article, <i>O'Reilly falsely claimed Best Buy employee confirmed ban on "Merry Christmas"</i> because the conversation is between O'Reilly and a customer.  Even if the conversation was between O'Reilly and an employee, it would probably still fail <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> because there is no way he can verify who he is talking to.  <a href="/wiki/User:Tuxide" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 02:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><br />
I don't think you read what I wrote.  I mentioned O'Reilly's coverage because it implies that criticisms (whether true or false) generated significant controversy.  This rebuts the charges that the criticism applied to retailers in general or that the controversy was minor.
</p><p>Please note everything in the actual Wikipedia article (see below) is fully backed by the AP article.  The comments from the Catholic League and the AFA are taken from their respective websites.   These citations satisfy the WP:V criterion.

<li>Specificity: There is a Best-Buy-specific campaign by the AFA.</li></ul>
<p>Are there any other objections? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a> 14 February, 2007
</p>
<dl><dd>Okay, let me break this down for you.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Veracity: It is NOT backed by the AP article.  The AP article simply stated that Best Buy was not using the word "Christmas" in its advertising.  Don't add anything to it, don't take anything from it.  Your contribution is not based on the AP article, it's based on lies told by O'Reilly.</li></ul>
<p><small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:B2bomber81" title="User talk:B2bomber81">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/B2bomber81" title="Special:Contributions/B2bomber81">contribs</a>) 21:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>If you read my contribution, you'll find no mention or citation of O'Reilly.  My contribution contains two things.  (1) It contains BBY spokeswoman Dawn Bryant's quote about Best Buy policy.  (2) It mentions the AFA and the Catholic League's negative reaction.  That's it.  My contribution is <b>100% factual</b>.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a> 14 February, 2007</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Notability:  Again, you use O'Reilly as a basis for notability, as well as Snopes.  Not sufficient evidence for notability.  You've been told that several times already. Get over it. It is insufficient.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>Is the Associated Press sufficient?</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Specificity: The AF-who?  Who cares?  Their campaign was based on (again) the lies were told by O'Reilly.</li></ul>
<p>The entire "No Christmas Controversy" is a sham started by O'Reilly, then it cascaded into the AFA's ban of Best Buy which was based on O'Reillys lies in the first place.  Your contribution is based on nothing, which makes it inappropriate for Wikipedia.  Go find something else to occupy your time.
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>Your AFA-got-it-from-O'Reilly claim is wrong.  The American Family Association started its campaign on Nov. 10, 2006.  This is <b>well before</b> Bill O'Reilly's feature on the Best Buy policy, which aired Nov. 29, 2006.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>The AFA campaign is based exclusively on the AP article.  See this link to confirm: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.afa.net/petitions/email/bestbuy_11102006.html">[5]</a><a href="/w/index.php?title=User:148.87.1.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:148.87.1.170 (page does not exist)">148.87.1.170</a> 14 February, 2007</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I have come to a solution that will satisfy my end on the inclusion of a no-christmas paragraph.  The paragraph can exist only if the templates &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Content" title="Template:Content">content</a>&#125;&#125; and &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Mergeto" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>&#125;&#125; are above it.  The use of the first template requires that the disputed content should stop being removed.  The reason that I am bringing this up is to keep this thing from being edit-warred over, and to encourage discussion on this topic from other Wikipedians.  By proposing this I do not mean to imply <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DNFT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DNFT">WP:DNFT</a>, because I do not want to label anyone with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TROLL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> yet; however this will go to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WQA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WQA">WP:WQA</a> if this discussion continues irrespective of Wikipedia's <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DICK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DICK">WP:DICK</a> rule.

<dl><dd>It's quite clear that this person, only identified as 148.87.1.170, 148.87.1.170 and 24.218.124.62, is an obvious vandal.  My only regret is that I kept arguing with the troll instead of just following warning procedure to get him banned.  If you look at his contribs, he's got a long history of vandalism. A consensus was reached already that this content does not meet Notability guidelines.  Yes, it meets verifiability guidelines because it was published by Associate Press.  But the argument for notability was that the AFA and Catholic League mention it on their website.  This does not satisfy [[WP:Notability].  It states <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other.</i>  I think the page needs to be reverted back to version #108339637. Lastly, we need to return to the discussion of whether a Criticism section should even be kept on this page.  It's well documented in Wikipedia guidelines that Criticism sections only serve to attract trolls and spawn frequent edit-wars.  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 07:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>My argument is not that the passage fails <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:N" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:N">WP:N</a>, but the inclusion of such passages on multiple retailer articles fails <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree.  You will notice you won't see this information posted on the Catholic League or AFA articles.  Just the retailers.  If this is such a major issue for the CL and the AFA, I find it interesting that such effort hasn't been made to get this information posted on THEIR articles.  My proposition is that this be removed from the Best Buy article, and that the appropriate information be added to the CL's and AFA's article.  For example, the CL's quote could be posted on their article, and the AFA's quote could be posted on theirs.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>My opinion is to do what <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Criticism" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a> says, and I know it's an essay.  In the past, there has been some movement to make it a guideline.  My interpretation is that the passage should go into <a href="/wiki/Christmas_controversy" class="mw-redirect" title="Christmas controversy">christmas controversy</a>, and a wikilink to this article should go into the <i>See also</i> section of the Best Buy, Catholic League, and American Family Association articles, etc.  I am considering posting a request on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WQA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WQA">WP:WQA</a> merely for some outside opinions on this, since my opinion can no longer be considered "outside".  Also, this talk page needs to be archived, and the active topics (prominently this one) needs to be refactored into a few bullet points.

You seem to want to segregate the "War-on-Christmas" criticism of Best Buy, Wal Mart, and other retailers into its own article.  But as mentioned above, <a href="/wiki/PETA" class="mw-redirect" title="PETA">PETA</a>'s criticism of <a href="/wiki/KFC" title="KFC">KFC</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a> is integrated in articles for both the source and target of criticism.  As the PETA precedent suggests, integrated criticism sections are standard and reasonable. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.218.124.62&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.218.124.62 (page does not exist)">24.218.124.62</a>
</p>
<dl><dd>Fast-food restaurants and circuses are outside the scope of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RETAIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RETAIL">WikiProject Retailing</a>; therefore I am not really interested in them.  The inclusion of this content is also disputed.  If I had a say, content should remain in the PETA article, and the articles <a href="/wiki/KFC" title="KFC">KFC</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a> should have a link to <a href="/wiki/PETA" class="mw-redirect" title="PETA">PETA</a> in its <i>See also</i> section.

<p>Hi -- there's a lot more information about best buy <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Best_Buy_(BBY)">here</a>, and the information at this site is complementary to the material about best buy already up on Wikipedia (it tends to focus on the company's business model and business prospects rather than from a cultural / encyclopedic perspective).

Best Buy is criticized by the <a href="/wiki/American_Family_Association" title="American Family Association">American Family Association</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_League" class="mw-disambig" title="Catholic League">Catholic League</a> for not using the word "christmas" in its advertising and not allowing employees to use the word to their customers.

<ul><li>This inclusion is supported, as it passes Notability and Original research policies with flying colors. I think the fact that when you search "Best Buy Christmas" in Google, most of the results are about this controversy, is enough to merit inclusion. In otherwords, if someone is just searching for Christmas items at Best Buy by entering those search terms, they will encounter the controversy. The NY Times, Snopes.com, USA Today, and various other very notable and popular newsmagazines have released articles about the Best Buy-Christmas issue, so it is definitely to remain. --<a href="/wiki/User:Sarcha_45" title="User:Sarcha 45">Sarcha 45</a> 22:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

However it's still hard, for me at least, distinguishing between what is different between the main controversy article and the paragraph within this article other than Best Buy's response seems to have been used more often in reports last year which in itself does not seem controversial unique to the particular company.  <a href="/wiki/User:Tmore3" title="User:Tmore3">Tmore3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tmore3" title="User talk:Tmore3">talk</a>) 20:23, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

<p>It has come to our attention that certain users wish to make format changes to the Best Buy page. This is an opportunity for those users to present their case and win support. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Memejojo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Memejojo (page does not exist)">Memejojo</a> 14:56, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>Perhaps "we" refers to your multiple accounts that you hold, or perhaps your personalities - but either way, you do not hold ownership to the Best Buy article.  And that is what you are inferring in your posts.  I edited your addition to the Best Buy article for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul><li>The website to which you link is simply an editorial.  Not sure that it even meets the requirements as a reliable source.  Last I checked, "watchdog editors" aren't included as a reliable source.</li></ul>
<ul><li>All you have done here is reprint the allegations that this newspaper editor is making against Best Buy.  Nothing is even quoted from the Attorney General.  So I am highly suspect of your motives here.  Do you want to state the facts about the Attorney Generals concerns, or do you simply trying to perpetuate a smear campaign?</li></ul>
<ul><li>You can't include an alledged quote, and simply cite it as "Best Buy spokesperson".  Include names or don't include the content.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Correction, this is indeed an editorial.  It is quite clearly labeled as "Consumer Watchdog", and the writer is also referred to as a columnist.  This is not a news story such as you would find in the Associate Press.  This is one man's crusade that has gotten the attention of the Attorney General.  I'm not disputing the inclusion of this story - I'm simply insisting that only the facts be included here, and to refrain from including your opinions.

<p>It is assumed that B2bomber81 is the one who is throwing out baseless allegations of multiple accounts. I would assume he is the one responsible for harrassment and marking up other user's wikipages. So with that said. I don't think this discussion should be used for silly tit for tat. I suggest removal of user to user speech in this forum immediately. If I have no objections I will clean up the above post and this one so that the topic of discussion may be more focused and coherent for the wikipedia community. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Memejojo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Memejojo (page does not exist)">Memejojo</a> 17:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I've never heard that rule before (most people "know" that God exists, that doesn't verify that he exists), and the only rules that matter here are ones with a Policy or Guideline boilerplate.  I'm sure most of the Best Buy employees I know wouldn't be able to even ballpark the fraction of stores with the bilingual signs.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Paul_Cyr&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Paul Cyr (page does not exist)">Paul Cyr</a> 02:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Paul Cyr, I'm not too sure if either "many" or "some" is acceptable, as per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WEASEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>.

<dl><dd>Tuxide, I think it's okay in this case because the section that it is in (Demographics) explains how Best Buy tailors it's stores for certain demographics in the store's area - and it has sources included that verify that.  This photo could be considered an example of one of the ways Best Buy does this.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think if we change the caption to something simple like "An example of bilingual signs that are used in some Best Buy stores", that eliminates the weasel words in question.  What do you think?  <a href="/wiki/User:B2bomber81" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 14:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I think WP:WEASEL is directed at presenting POVs that may not be credible enough. "Some people feel..." in this case it is being used for the "number of x with y" or "some stores with bilingual signs".

<dl><dd>who cares what the employees know, that is irrelevant. and most people believe in god, no one knows, however most people know when somthing is plausable and likely to be able to be proved and verified. and FYI its somewhere in the four pillars.<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Qrc2006" title="User talk:Qrc2006"><sup><b>T</b> <i>ALK</i></sup></a>•<a href="/wiki/User:Qrc2006" title="User:Qrc2006"><sup>Q</sup><small>R</small><sub>C</sub>2006</a>•<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Qrc2006" title="Special:Contributions/Qrc2006">¢ʘñ†®¡ß§</a> 20:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>When you claim that most people know it to be true, when a lot of employees don't even know, it is most certainly relevent (since they of all people should know).  My point about god was to show that your claim about "a rule that says if most people generally know it to be true thats enough verifiability" is a rediculous notion.  And it is in the five pillars... the one that says, "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia...

See the official policy <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Furthermore, Best Buy's policy is non-notable as hundreds of other retailers in Western states have a similar bilingual signage policy (e.g., Wal-Mart).

<p>I would like to see some discussion of Best Buy's customer service record. I have been extremely dissatisfied with my experiences at the store and the poor customer service I recieved both in the store and on the phone. After speaking with my friends about my experiences, I discovered that many people I know have had similar Best Buy stories, being so dissatisfied that they reccount detailed stories of poor service even years after the incidents occurred. I even came across a webpage devoted to people's negative experiences at Best Buy, some former customers have posted with rage there. I think this aspect of the store's reputation should be discussed.  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.168.202.48" title="Special:Contributions/71.168.202.48">71.168.202.48</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.168.202.48&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.168.202.48 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:06, 1 September 2007 (UTC)</small>

<hr /><p> Citations relating to best buy customer service ----------
</p><p>The arguments to ignore Best Buys well known customer service issues are inadequate.  Yes every major retailer has dissatisfied customers, but almost none if any, to the extent of disdain garnered by best buy.  I've collated some links to emphasize the point that Best Buy is well known for it's terrible customer service.  Sites like bestbuysux(now defunct) and ihatebestbuy don't get the number of hits and posts they do for no reason.

</p><p>Tuxide makes a great point. Future Shop is not the same store as Best Buy.

</p><p>Future Shop was an independent company before being owned by Best Buy--its corporate culture is completely different than its originally American counterpart. The demographic of Future Shop is entirely different than that of Best Buy. If I'm not mistaken Future Shop is also the only big electronics retailer that still works on commission and in Canada, Future Shop sells appliances and Best Buy doesn't. I daresay while the article is weak, it could be improved--if Geek Squad, which is a small division of Best Buy, can warrant its own article, then why not Future Shop, which is a four and a half billion dollar company? What about Magnolia Audio Video, whose article is almost as weak as that of Future Shop? Or even any other company they own? I'll get my hands dirty with the improvement of the article if it'll help this situation--although I strayed away from it due to potential conflict of interest. 
Either way, I'm all in favour of not merging, but improving. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AbstractEpiphany&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AbstractEpiphany (page does not exist)">AbstractEpiphany</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AbstractEpiphany" title="User talk:AbstractEpiphany">talk</a>) 01:12, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

For example, <a href="/wiki/Target_Corporation" title="Target Corporation">Target Corporation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wal-Mart" class="mw-redirect" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> are articles about the parent companies and not necessarily their main retail chains (although they serve as the articles for the chains).  As of now, it looks like an article about the parent company to me, and <a href="/wiki/Future_Shop" title="Future Shop">Future Shop</a> looks like an article mainly about the subsidiary instead of the chain.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>As of December 2007, the actual BestBuy.com national website is not available to consumers without the help of a Best Buy sales person from a Best Buy in store terminal. A Best Buy employee must log-in to the "Employee Toolkit" Intranet system in order to access the national Best Buy.com website. This exposes Best Buy to security issues as a customer could potentially have access to internal Best Buy systems while viewing out the "actual" BestBuy.com. Best Buy publishes "This website reflects in-store pricing. Please see a Best Buy associate if you have any questions" on the main page of the Intranet based Best Buy.com when a customer accesses the terminal without going through the "Employee Toolkit". This notification was not posted on the Intranet based site until after Best Buy was accused of over-charging customers from the Connecticut State Attorney General.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Bestbuy.com, as listed on the terminal publicly, is actually an Intranet based version of Bestbuy.com that shows in store pricing. In store pricing on many items is typically higher than BestBuy.com, although this varies from region to region; it is possible for an item to actually be less expensive in the store. Items typically sold in the store are more expensive or the same price on the Intranet version of the terminal, but items only available online typically are the same price as the "actual" BestBuy.com national website. Best Buy does price match BestBuy.com prices, so a customer can bring in evidence of a lower price online and can receive a refund of the difference.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Best Buy has removed a loophole in their "Employee Toolkit" internal login system that allowed employees to use Internet Explorer without major restriction.

<p>As a current employee of Best Buy, I would like to add that the folowing is not completely true.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Best Buy has removed a loophole in their "Employee Toolkit" internal login system that allowed employees to use Internet Explorer without major restriction. This action prevents customers and employees from surfing the Internet, but also prevents customers from doing Internet price comparisons and checks on product reviews.[18]
</p>

<p>Technically they never removed the way that employees accessed the internet.  Employees had to go through a link that took them to yahoo finance regarding our current stock price where they could find an internet search bar.  The link has been broken for a while and now we have our own internal page regarding the current selling price of our stock.
</p><p>There is a new link on the homepage of the "Employee Toolkit" called "Favorites" where employees can type in any URL including Google or Yahoo. URLs are saved for future use. This has actually made it much easier for employees to access the internet from our intranet.  The customer cannot access this without the help from an employee since a login and password are required to access the "Employee Toolkit".  
</p><p>The majority of our stores have wireless networks available with proper proxy numbers.  Most now have Apple stores inside them which have open access to the internet for customers, also.  I have no interest in editing the actual page, if someone would like to fix this, please do.

<dl><dd>Well, you're both right and wrong on that. Customers still can't see the price on the national BBY.com without the help of an employee, unless they have a phone with a mobile web browsing service. But I agree that it needs to be rewritten for clarity and truthiness. Frankly, what Best Buy needs to do is have one website, with both the "local" and "national" price listed on the same page.

<p>If I remember correctly, after the June 14th tornado (and later tornado sale), the Sound of Music store in Roseville (Snelling Ave. &amp; CR B) changed their sign to read "The Sound of Music Best Buy store" - or possibly "Sound of Music's Best Buy store". Seems like a useful piece of historical info..does anyone else recall this?

<p>Bestbuy also owns (in full or in part): Rocketfish, Dynex and Insignia. 
I don't have a source for this, but this is what I was told as an employee of the company.

<p>As much as there seems to be efforts to insert an elongated three paragraph version of this lawsuit, there seems to be as equal opposition to removing it entirely. I still have preoccupations about mentioning it at all since there seems to be little reporting outside of a few tech blogs. Nevertheless for the sake of compromise at least for now I've summarized and sourced the single source where the other two sources were reporting from.   Open to discussion but continuing to just re-insert the extensive details of a pending lawsuit seems unjustifiable and definitely of undue weight at this point. <a href="/wiki/User:Tmore3" title="User:Tmore3">Tmore3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tmore3" title="User talk:Tmore3">talk</a>) 19:36, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

</p><p>As someone who worked on the Best Buy Project Teams for nearly 13 years, specifically building and opening new stores, I can definitely state with fully certainty that Best Buy does NOT have 6,000 stores and that the total count is somewhere closer to 1,100 as stated.  When I first started in Oct 1996 the count was at 345.
