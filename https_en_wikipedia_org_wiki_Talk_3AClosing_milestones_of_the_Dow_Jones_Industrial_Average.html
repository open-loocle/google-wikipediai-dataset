<p>This section is basically speculation and isn't really encyclopedic. In my opinion, the history aspect of this article is great, but the future predictions should be eliminated. <a href="/wiki/User:Carrp" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Carrp" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 05:30, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I very much agree and removed the main speculation and moved the rest of the text up to the intro, above the lists. Seems like the list could use coverage of the Great Depression-related bear market, since it was such a major shaper of the US in the 20th century. <a href="/wiki/User:Niteowlneils" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 04:44, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>"A new bull market cannot begin until market valuation (measured by way of PE ratio) is back to multi-decade lows."
That is a POV statement predictive of the future that isn't even sourced. The offical defination of a secular bull market is however such that until the DOW makes an all time high, neither the end of the previous bear market nor the beginning of that bull market can be called. <a href="/wiki/User:Joncnunn" title="User:Joncnunn">Jon</a> 13:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The intraday high on January 14, 2000 was indeed 11750.28 "according to some but not substantiated by any intraday chart" (quote interjected by Anonymous); however, the "theoretical high", which is calculated as if the intraday highs of all 30 stocks were hit at once, was 11908.50 "and substantiated by intraday graphs [links at bottom]" (also interjected by Anonymous). This 150+ point spread between the "actual" and "theoretical" highs may be accounted for by the fact that January 14, 2000 was an extremely volatile trading day, meaning that the individual stock highs may have been highly spread in time. 
</p><p>The "theoretical" method was the only way to calculate highs or lows until early 1992, when technology allowed the index to be calculated every 10 seconds. Even on October 4, 2006, when the actual high eclipsed the intraday high of six years before by 100 points, the theoretical high of 11879 still failed to set a new record. This may have been caused by a number of factors, including the decrease in volatility between 2000 and 2006 and the dynamics of that particular trading day. The actual high of 11851 was set seconds before the close, meaning that in all likelihood the vast majority of the 30 stocks hit their highs simultaneously. 
</p><p>During the 2000-2002 bear market, the lows were (closing, actual, theoretical): 
(7286, 7197, 7181) on October 9-10, 2002. As many will recall, a market-wide rally ensued upon breaking 7200 on October 10, and virtually no new lows were hit in any of the individual stocks for the rest of the day. Thus, there was only a 16-point spread for actual and theoretical lows in spite of high general volatility.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/User:DAP" title="User:DAP">65.27.233.132</a> 12:50, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
</p><p>The above referenced concept of a difference in "theoretical" and "actual" intraday highs is not supported by the graphs below, making it suspect as an indicator.
</p><p>There is argument over the intraday high since the graphs (links below) substantiate a high on January 14, 2000 of 11,908.50 and none show any such high on October 5, 2006.

</p><p>The theoretical high of 11,928 is substantiated by marketwatch.com and is shown on a chart from that site (links below). MarketWatch (including BigCharts, linked above) and Yahoo charts usually show the theoretical highs and lows if each bar represents a period of 1 day or longer. Charts from other financial sites (such as StockCharts) show the actual highs and lows reached during intraday trading regardless of the length of time each bar represents. Of course, for intraday charts (such as the Yahoo chart linked above), only actual data can be shown in a continuous manner, regardless of the source. Both "theoretical" sites show highs of 11,921 on October 6 and 11,924 on October 9 - so any way you slice it, the nominal high of 2000 has been passed. Furthermore, in response to the provocative statement above, the "theoretical" vs. "actual" concept is factual (I will find and post the link), although as with many types of market data, its usefulness as an indicator is a matter of opinion. A link to a Yahoo chart of the Dow since 1928 (in <a href="/wiki/Log_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Log scale">log scale</a> for greater visibility) on the main entry page substantiates all the "theoretical" highs except 11,928, which is substantiated by the MarketWatch link.

</p><p>This link, if accessed between midnight and 9 am on any given weekday or any time on the weekend, shows the Dow for the previous day, with the "actual" intraday chart at right and the "theoretical" high and low documented at left (the 52-week high and low are also shown to be "theoretical" if you check them against StockCharts.com):

<p>Interesting to note that the amount of time it took the Dow to go from its first close above 11,000, to its first close above 12,000 - which was about 7 1/2 years - was the longest time it took the Dow to make one of these 1000pt jumps since the Dow made the first 1000pt jump - from 1000 to 2000, which took from 1972-1987 (15 years). Every other jump was completed in a much quicker time-frame - most of them around 1 year. Should this be mentioned in relation to the dot-com bubble bear market? This very slow pace of increase? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:155.143.221.252&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:155.143.221.252 (page does not exist)">155.143.221.252</a> 17:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Yes this is due to the Dot Com Crash. The tech heavy NASDAQ sell from about 9000pt's down to 2000pt's. Although the Dow index is not tech heavy, there was still a sell off as well as limited growth for the next few years. Also the quickest jump was from 13000-14000pt's this took only months! April 25, 2007 to July 17, 2007, only 113 days.</dd></dl>

<p>With a new section detailing how many trading days the Dow took to go from one millenary milestone to the next, it's now appropriate to reopen this discussion.  While it's nice to know this information and be excited whenever the Dow reaches its next millenary milestone, 1000-pt increments are going to become meaningless as the Dow continues to rise higher, possibly above <a href="/wiki/Dow_36,000" title="Dow 36,000">36,000</a> in a few years.  If the Dow does continue its Trump-fueled rally to higher levels, it will be more likely that a point swing of hundreds of points will become normal; this is why we don't apply bold formatting to every 1000-pt milestone. <a href="/wiki/User:OfficerAPC" class="mw-redirect" title="User:OfficerAPC">OfficerAPC</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:OfficerAPC" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:OfficerAPC">talk</a>) 21:55, 17 January 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>2003 or 2004, the bear market was still prevailant.  By 2004 and 2005, the market was beginning to recover thanks to China and the housing market.   However, since 2006, there's has been a bull market.  The showing of the full recovery from that subprime mortgage meltdown in February and the unexpected earnings this quarter shows the economy has been tested through housing bubble brusting.  Today's show has me wondering if we're back to this 90s bull market. <a href="/wiki/User:Spongefan" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Spongefan">Spongefan</a> 21:01, 25 April 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The start of the bull market is controversial and more discussion is needed before its causes can be identified in an encyclopedic fashion.  I would say the Dow was very bullish from March 2003 all the way to February 2004, and then pretty bearish for most of 2004. Then, some would argue we were still in a bear because the Dow was down for the 2005 calendar year, yet it seems superficial to call the start of the bull market 2006 just because the old high was passed then. The other bull market start dates in this article (1949, 1982, etc.) seem to be based on when the P/E ratio of the Dow hit its low for the time period. If anyone knows when this happened in the past five years, they should edit the article accordingly. Until then, it should probably be reverted. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:129.137.228.196&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:129.137.228.196 (page does not exist)">129.137.228.196</a> 22:09, 26 April 2007 (UTC)DAP</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I've heard numerous times from market historians and financial analysts that stocks have
historically returned an average of about 10% per year since the 1920s, but the data in these
graphs don't support this claim. For example, consider the Dow's closing value of 200.93 on
Dec. 19, 1927, and its record-high closing value of 14164.53 on Oct. 9, 2007, covering a
time-span of approximately 80 years. Using the annual-compound-interest formula N(t) =
N(to)*(1+i)^n, where N(t) and N(to) = Dow's closing values at times t and to, respectively;
i = annual compound interest rate; and n = number of years between to and t; then: 14164.53 =
200.93*(1+i)^80. Solving for i yields i = 5.463%. That is, according to my calculations, the Dow
has increased, on average, only 5.463% (not 10% as market historians claim) per year over the
past 80 years, and this doesn't even include the Dow's current skid (in which the Dow is
currently below 8400 at the time of this writing). Are these data inaccurate or my calculations
incorrect? Where do the market historians obtain their numbers to make their 10% claim?

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hi.  Thanks for the information.  May I ask, where do you get the raw data for the daily opening and closing values?  I had assumed that an unchanged DJIA value (i.e., a change of 0.00 points from one day to the next) was a rare occurrence.  But you have shown dozens of incidences of this -- although, only four in the last 10 years.  (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JosephASpadaro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JosephASpadaro (page does not exist)">JosephASpadaro</a> 20:34, 28 May 2007 (UTC))
<dl><dd>Source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.econstats.com/eqty/eq_d_mi_3.htm">[1]</a>  This is only a change of 0.0, and it's rarer recently because a tenth of a point was a bigger deal in the past than it is now -- like if the DJIA is 50, 50.1 is a 2% difference, but if it's 5000, it's a .02% difference, which is harder to nail.</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the info.  I looked at the source data that you provided, and it raised another question for me that perhaps you can answer.  I had always assumed that the DJIA opening value for any day was <i>exactly</i> the same number as the DJIA closing value for the day before.  Is that assumption wrong?  In other words, if the market closes on the afternoon of June 4 at exactly 13,000.00 -- does not the market open on the morning of June 5 at exactly 13,000.00?  If not, why not?  (What happens to the number in the interim between one day's close and the next day's opening?)    If so, how come your source data has different opening and closing values for consecutive days?

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Also, as a correction to your prior posting:  one-tenth of a point when the DJIA is 50 equates to 0.2% and one-tenth of a point when the DJIA is 5,000 equates to 0.002%.

<dl><dd>Yeah, good call on the percentage.  Gives you a lot of faith that I did the math right on those graphs, huh?

<p>Might check me on this, but I believe the change on 7/17/1990 actually was 0.00 - I read somewhere the market closed at 2,999.75 for two consecutive days before plunging into the Gulf crisis. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:65.27.236.224&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:65.27.236.224 (page does not exist)">65.27.236.224</a> 20:05, 10 June 2007 (UTC)DAP

<p>Reports on new all-time highs for the Dow Jones or any other stock market have always bothered me, and fortunately others <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cbpp.org/10-5-06bud.htm">[2]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.itulip.com/realdow.htm">[3]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/editorials/2007/0416.html">[4]</a> as well, as inflation is stubbornly ignored. This happens elsewhere as well; two years back I converted the <a href="/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_paintings" title="List of most expensive paintings">list of most expensive paintings</a> to an inflation-adjusted list in which Van Gogh's "Irises", that sold for $54 million in 1987, rightfully beats Picasso's  "Dora Maar au Chat" that sold for $95 million in 2006. Still, you can be sure that the next painting sold for a dollar over $140 million (the ridiculous 2006 record price for a <a href="/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> painting, of all things) will be hailed everywhere as the most expensive work of art ever sold. Somehow the proclamations of new highs remind me of the announcements in <a href="/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> on the supposedly ever-declining price of chocolate. I'm blissfully ignorant of economics, and someone may explain here (and in the article, please) why inflation does not matter. Otherwise, an inflation adjusted graph should be welcome here.

<dl><dd>Yes the removal of anything related to current events is appropriate since they are still unsettled at the moment and the article has a longer perspective. Either of three things was inevitable when one looks at the DOW over it's entire history with respect to the observed curve: a smooth continued exponential growth either under the bases of the bubbles or thru their midpoints which would have brought the DOW to 20K by 2010; a leveling out at some point and then lateral movement; or a crash and complete deflation of the bubbles as well as a deep cut into the overall <a href="/wiki/Secular_trend" class="mw-redirect" title="Secular trend">secular trend</a> since the mid eighties. At this point it's still unclear what the final outcome would be and in the perspective of this article at least a years worth of observation would be necessary before naming the current stage. <a href="/wiki/User:Lycurgus" title="User:Lycurgus">Lycurgus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lycurgus" title="User talk:Lycurgus">talk</a>) 01:57, 16 October 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Sorry, this Theoretical Dow stuff needs to be deleted.  To be clear, the reason is because the higher the volatility, the higher the theoretical high.  Volatility should be irrelevant.  We could care less about how the dow was calculated long ago.  It's not relevant whatsoever to anything.  It just causes confusion.  It's like publishing the weekly highs, or the S&amp;P daily high if all the stocks in the S&amp;P reached their highs at the same time in the week.

<dl><dd>I'm inclined to agree with you.  If they track all 30 components all day long, why would it be useful to have a number which assumes that all 30 components reached their daily high at the same time of the day (when they almost never do).  These "theoretical" numbers have been part of the article for years, though.

<dl><dd>I disagree. I find the theoretical value more interesting for longterm informational purposes. It shows, arguably to a point, whether the actual high was a blip in the radar or if the actual high was maintained for a prolonged period of time. As a side note the theoretical high might take place on a different day from the actual high, further strengthening my point.

<dl><dd>My take is that its the opposite of what you say.  If Chevron and ExxonMobil hit their highs in the morning and P&amp;G and J&amp;J hit their highs in the afternoon then the Theoretical Dow will have moved a lot more in the day than the Dow.  I thought the point of using many stocks in your index was to smooth out the noise of each individual stocks behavior... but with the theoretical Dow the intra-day radar blips will be magnified which is the opposite of telling you if things are being maintained for a long period of time.<a href="/wiki/User:DavidRF" title="User:DavidRF">DavidRF</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DavidRF" title="User talk:DavidRF">talk</a>) 22:27, 28 March 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I guess you have convinced me especially due to the outdated nature of the theoretical high. The only other reason to keep it would be to compare the pre-1992 closings which used the theoretic high numbers to the current theoretical high as this is more appropriate compariblity to pre-1992.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:King1257&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:King1257 (page does not exist)">King1257</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:King1257" title="User talk:King1257">talk</a>) 13:56, 1 April 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>This is about the recent removal of some 100-point milestone increments. Note that the Dow Jones has been essentially undergoing exponential growth (as expected, perhaps). The 100-point increments would be more appropriate for something that grows <i>linearly</i>, not <i>exponentially</i>. Taking this into consideration, it is not unfathomable that in the future, the Dow Jones will fluctuate daily by thousands of points, and the 100-point increments would not adequately reflect the activity of the DJIA.
</p><p>Further incentive for the removal of some of the increments is that it does not put the jump from, say 500 to 600 into perspective. Reaching 600 from 500 is far more significant than reaching 16100 from 16000.
</p><p>Please voice any concerns here, or, post on my talk page (this is faster, and preferred) if you disagree with this action. Thanks. — <b><i><a href="/wiki/User:Andy_M._Wang" title="User:Andy M.

<dl><dd>After consideration I liked your point and agree that the way it was being handled before with 100-point increments all of the way up to current the old data was not being emphasized enough. Along that same line I added some data to the bottom end of the spectrum. I made the following changes: 10-point increments are used up to the 200 level, 50 to 500, 100 to 2,000, 500 to 5,000, and 1,000-point increments thereafter. Let me know if this sounds appropriate, I figured that we should use the same scale all the way up for consistancy and to show the old data with the same level of detail that the newer data is being shown with. The only issue I see is if this pattern is extrapolated out, there will be a 5,000-point jump after 20,000, however, in theory if the dow keeps growing exponentially this would only be a temporary problem. Anyone let me know if they have any better solutions to the exponential problem.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I have been wondering when this kind of change would happen. It seems obvious to me that one is losing prospective of how indexes are changing when there is <i>too much</i> data. I would suggest that one should ignore the point changes in favor of percentage changes, but that would be difficult to implement and to understand. But I feel uncomfortable with the details of your suggestion, as it seems to introduce inequality in the changes of the jumps. To make the changes understandable and even are conflicting goals. But let suggest this as one which falls on the evenness side: From 100 to 200, jumps of 10; from 200 to 400, jumps of 20; from 400 to 800, jumps of 40; ... from 100 x 2<sup>n</sup> to 100 x 2<sup>n+1</sup>, jumps of 10 x 2<sup>n</sup>. To repeat myself, this is not practicable or understandable and I most surely do not favor it. (A mathematician might suggest: From 100 to 316 (square root of 10), jumps of 10; from 316 to 1000, jumps of 30; ... .) Anyway, I <b>strongly agree</b>  with the idea of scaling the increments in proportion to the base, even if I have cavils about the details.     Of course, the same is true of the S&amp;P 500, and whatever change it ought to be applied equally to both indexes.  <a href="/wiki/User:TomS_TDotO" title="User:TomS TDotO">TomS TDotO</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TomS_TDotO" title="User talk:TomS TDotO">talk</a>) 09:39, 6 June 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>One idea that I had in changing the scaling point that the milestones occure is haing it be in increments of 10 from 100 to 200, increments of 20 from 200 to 500, increments of 50 from 500 to 1000, 100 from 1000 to 2000, 200 from 2000 to 5000, etc... This doesn't completely eliminate the inequalities, but it does lessen them. I am going to change the increment scale on the chart to reflect this change. Let me know if anyone has any more input on this. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:King1257&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:King1257 (page does not exist)">King1257</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:King1257" title="User talk:King1257">talk</a>) 14:06, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

<dd>King1257, I am strongly in favor of reverting your recent additions on 6 June 2014, back to increments starting with 10, not 5. The list currently takes up half the scrolling length of the article. Is this article meant to be text-heavy, or be primarily a list of Dow points with dates? One of the minor reasons for my cuts a few days ago is to reduce the size of the list, as it has begun overshadowing much of the other content of the article. If you really prefer a list that long, I may suggest cutting some text, so that the article feels more like a list (if that was intended). Otherwise, I'm in favor of cutting some of the increments again. Thanks. — <b><i><a href="/wiki/User:Andy_M._Wang" title="User:Andy M.

<p>ISTM that the numbered notes should be done by the ordinary means, like footnotes for citations, rather than the clumsily with marking superscripts etc. The standard method has many benefits.

<p>The "Records" section (which says the currently standing closing, intraday, and theoretical intraday records) is currently in the middle of the page, with a bunch of less interesting stuff below it.

<p>Prediction of an economic effect of a major change in market valuations so far seems about as reliable as astrological charts. A stock market crash as in 1987 can be a blip -- or a sign of an impending meltdown in the economy. The 28.3% reduction in share values (I write this on 3/13/2020) is a huge, swift  drop in valuation; we may have different interpretations of what such means. We do not know what follows.
</p><p>Most serious recessions have a big decline in securities prices as at the least a portent. 
</p><p>We do not know yet. I have thus treated the statement that the world is not on the brink of a serious recession as dubious. So far market valuations look like a 'falling knife'. That can continue or come to an end, and nobody can predict when that perception (and reality) come to an end. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Pbrower2a&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pbrower2a (page does not exist)">Pbrower2a</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Pbrower2a" title="User talk:Pbrower2a">talk</a>) 07:22, 13 March 2020 (UTC)
