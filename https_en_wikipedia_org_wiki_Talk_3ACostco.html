<p>On a page like this I would like a section on how retailers like Costco come by the products they sell us. I want to know where these products come from and how they are made. If they are made over seas, I would like to know if the employment practices are fair. The stores are not required to release this information, I guess, because there is nothing on Costco's website regarding this. Just something to consider, maybe after I find the answers to these questions I will come back and fill the info in myself.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:64.91.118.40&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:64.91.118.40 (page does not exist)">64.91.118.40</a> 15:41, 25 April 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>You pose several questions. Let me make certain I understand each one of them.
</p><p>1. You want to know how Costco decides what items to sell, which brand/size? I don't have an answer to that.
2. Federal law requires every product to state the country of origin, so you can go into any Costco and look at each item and you'll find out where it came from.
3. If it's a third world country, probably not. Just because a manufacturer complies with all local laws doesn't mean squat. Do you think the local laws in Cambodia are "fair?" Canada/Europe probably yes it is fair.
4. There is no law requiring stores to compile/release this info, only the labeling law which applies to the manufacturer.
</p><p>As you investigate at Costco, may I reccomend rugs, bath towels and such. Go down the entire rug aisle at Costco, and count how many are made in USA. Then go to the towel/bath mat aisle. At most retailers, these products typically are made in third world countries, however my unscientific survey shows that most at Costco are made here (ususally the foreign-made exceptions are big brand names, whereas the regular stuff is USA). Then do the same thing at your local Sam's/Wal-Mart. I'm certain you'll find a HUGE difference. Yet you'll notice the prices are basically the same, and perhaps the quality is better at Costco, plus you are supporting American manufacturing jobs AND you are supporting good paying retail jobs--a real "win-win-win-win." Somewhat like paying the same price for the same items at your local unionized supermarket vs. the non-union supercenter.
</p><p>I look forward to seeing what you find out there! <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> 17:57, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

<ul><li>The employment section dispute is resolved. Can we archive the discussion to further clean up this page?</li>
<li>Someone requested a bunch of unnecessary citations. This is all stuff that is common knowledge, or is painfully obivious.</li>
<li>The recent additions to the working at Costco section need to be revised. Perhaps too much detail, not relevant to the overall picture. Some writing seems biased against certain job catagories, and some seems pro-Costco. I'm leaving this open for comments and not just deleting it. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> 23:33, 10 May 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Common knowledge or painfully obvious?  This is Wikipedia, almost everything has to be cited.  There are some very few exceptions for things like, "Milk is normally white", but beyond that kind of thing, no, it must be sourced.  Let me list some examples:</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>headquartered in Issaquah, Washington, United States, with its flagship warehouse in nearby Seattle. Costco's Canadian operations are based near Ottawa, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p></blockquote>
<dl><dd>Sorry, but if I ask 100 people where Costco is headquartered, 100 of them will say they have no idea.  That means it isn't common knowledge.  Obvious?  How?  Is Costco's full name really "Costco, HQ Issaquah WA with Canadian operations in Ottawa and Vancouver"?  Someone needs to do their homework and visit Costco's web site and find this listed there and cite it.  Laziness is no excuse for removing citation requests.</dd></dl>
<blockquote><p>
Although Sam's Club has more warehouses than Costco, Costco has higher total sales volume. Costco employs about 127,000 full- and part-time employees, including seasonal workers, and for fiscal year 2006, ended in September, the company's store sales totaled $59 billion of which $1.1 billion was net profit. Costco is #28 on the Fortune 500.</p></blockquote>
<dl><dd>Exactly how is this common knowledge or obvious?  Is there a huge sign outside of Costco stating, "We employ 127,000 people"?  Even if there was, a great many people never visit Costco or see the outside of it.  Many people outside of the USA have never even heard of Costco, believe it or not.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I could go on but I think you see my point.  If it is so common, then find some sources and cite it.  Otherwise, you have no justification for your removal of the cite tags.  If you still object to my tagging claims that have no citation, then we can try to get someone to mediate our dispute but I think it is "common knowledge" and "painfully obvious" that most people have no idea about the details of Costco's operations and finances.  99.99% of the world has no idea about the corporate set up of Costco.  <a href="/wiki/User:Fanra" title="User:Fanra">Fanra</a> 12:50, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Sorry, I was not clear. I don't expect 100 random folks to know like they would the sky is blue. What I do expect is that if they want to verify such easy stuff, they can do their own homework. Wikipedia is a source itself. If someone asks me (as a randon person) what the GDP rank of Macedonia is, I'd probably go to the UN to find out. That would also be easy to cite, whereas some of this Costco stuff isn't.
</p><p>Costco is the largest: you pull the sales volume of the big 4 clubs worldwide, and look at who is the highest. Someone must do that themselves, you can't cite that, because you're going to at least 4 different places, and YOU are doing the comparison, so my citation would be myself. # employees: look at an annual report, SEC filing, etc. Product packaging: you need to go into Costco and look for yourself if you want to dispute a claim. If you're not willing to do that, then you need to trust those of us that have done so. Fortune 500 ranking, you need to go to Fortune and look at the list. This is easy stuff, but not necessarily easy to cite.
</p><p>What **IS** lazy is to expect that every sentence in this article be cited (especially for this type of stuff). Therefore, your numerous fact tags and boxes are uncalled for (and those boxes look ugly to boot).
</p><p>I've already been thru a 2 month dispute and mediation regarding the employment section, and I'm not doing another one. I also allowed some guy to come in and delete an entire large section to which numerous folks had contributed (popular culture). I disagreed (along with all those contributors), and requested comments (got none) but I still allowed they guy to delete it. But enough is enough! I'm not going to allow any more nonsense. I'm not trying to be mean or rude, but this is what it is. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> 19:00, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I'm afraid that this is not a question of what you will "allow". Please read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and familiarize yourself with the policy. Further, it is official policy on Wikipedia (Please read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">about verifiability</a>) that facts contained in articles must be attributed directly to sources.

<ul><li>Rather than start an edit war I'm going to find citations for everything, since someone is too lazy to do it.  By the way, I already found one "fact" is incorrect, the claim that "127,000 full- and part-time employees, " employees is wrong.  According to Costco, the correct number is 132,000 full and part-time and I will cite my source.  <a href="/wiki/User:Fanra" title="User:Fanra">Fanra</a> 19:34, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>"Someone" too lazy would be several people who have added that stuff, it is not all from one person. I know you didn't intend to imply anything.&#160;:)
</p><p>Regarding the number of employees, when was 127,000 added? I'd guess the company has grown since then. Geesh.
</p><p>As for "allowing" stuff, I'm getting real tired of people acting as if they are somehow right and everyone else is wrong. I've already ***heavily*** compromised on the employment section, and I completely rolled over and let Eyrian delete the entire pop culture section, despite the fact that nobody else concurred with his opinion, but I'm not going to simply allow everyone and their dog to come in here and do whatever the heck they feel like because they have some sort of idea that they are the all-knowing God of the Universe. 
</p><p>The idea that every sentence needs to be cited is absurd. If someone wants to prove something is FALSE, go for it. Go look at 100 other articles and see if every sentence is cited, and don't start the absurd argument that they are also flawed. If they are also bad, you need to correct them as well...you can't just pick and choose. If 100 factories in Chicago are illegally dumping toxic waste in the river, then ALL 100 COMPANIES must be cited, not just one or two.
</p><p>As the article stands now, which citations are missing? Until someone PROVES that, the box is coming down. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> 22:40, 11 May 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<ul><li>"If they are also bad, you need to correct them as well...you can't just pick and choose." - I am trying to correct them all.  However, since English language Wikipedia has over 1 million articles, it's going to take me some time.&#160;:)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>As for the number of employees, that was just one of several errors I found.  "the company has grown since then", that's exactly why you cite this kind of stuff.  That way, someone can click the citation and see, "oh, that number was put here in 2005, so it might be different now".</dd>
<dd>Why did I come here and pick this article?  Well, I saw there was a dispute and decided to see if I could help.  When I looked at the article, I saw a lot of stuff but very few citations.  So, I figured if this article is being disputed, the first thing to do is try to make it as clean as possible so we can eliminate any other problems.  Also, since it was in dispute, perhaps it is more important than the other 900,000 articles on "Grog Smith (farmer born 500BC)".</dd>
<dd>"If someone wants to prove something is FALSE, go for it.", the burden of proof is on the person who put up the information, not the other way around.  I know that many articles don't have much proof, because in wikipedia, the idea is to get the information up first and then fix it and make it perfect.  So citations are just part of the process.  And this article is at that stage of the process.  We don't want to force anyone to cite everything, but we do want to mark it so that it is both known that it is uncited and that we would like someone to cite it if they find the time.  <a href="/wiki/User:Fanra" title="User:Fanra">Fanra</a> 20:31, 12 May 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>One reason this article keeps attracting attention from other editors is that it keeps getting pulled away (by a variety of editors) from an encyclopedic tone and toward one that we'd expect to see in a popular magazine, so it makes us suspicious of bias and more likely to question its claims.  Because it drops so many factoids (especially for a relatively straightforward topic compared to, say, "World War II"), it needs more citations than other articles of comparable length.  Also, if a statement requires synthesizing data from multiple sources (like how Costco is #1 based on sales volume, based on looking up the sales volume of its competitors), it's original research, which doesn't even belong in a wp article. <a href="/wiki/User:Lunkwill" title="User:Lunkwill">Lunkwill</a> 17:18, 25 May 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<ul><li>Ok, we seem to have some people who are going around switching Taiwan to Republic of China and back again.  Now the island of <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> is part of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" class="mw-redirect" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (ROC), not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" class="mw-redirect" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC) (Communist mainland China).  According to Costco, their stores are in Taiwan.  Note that Costco also says it has stores in "376 locations in 38 U.S. States &amp; Puerto Rico".  Note that Puerto Rico is part of the United States, but Costco doesn't just say, "376 locations in the U.S.".  Therefore, it is clear that Costco considers its stores by geographic location, not by political location.  More importantly, which is clearer for readers.  Many people can be confused when they see Republic of China into thinking it is mainland China.  Thus, many times when something is marked ROC or Republic of China, the word Taiwan is added.  To solve this problem, I'm going to do the same.  <a href="/wiki/User:Fanra" title="User:Fanra">Fanra</a> 21:11, 12 May 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>I agree. But ROC can really be confusing to almost everyone. ROC is usually used in political contexts, and this is obviously not a political article. Most importantly, the source says Taiwan, not the ROC. So I suggest that we change it back to Taiwan alone.--<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Jerrypp772000&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jerrypp772000 (page does not exist)">Jerrypp772000</a> 21:22, 12 May 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I know how touchy this issue can be. But as Fanra pointed out with the Puerto Rico example, this is more of a geographic thing and not a political.

<dd>I'm gonna say this again: ROC shouldn't be mentioned, this is not a political article.

<ul><li>I'm looking for a way that can compromise and keep everyone happy, well at least not really unhappy, with the main goal to be to make it clear and easy to understand.  Currently, it says <b>Taiwan, <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" class="mw-redirect" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a></b>.  That is the factually correct way to list it, since they are on the island of Taiwan which is in the Republic of China.  However, it is not the most clear way.  Unfortunately, a great many people confuse ROC with PRC and think that whenever they see the word China it is the PRC.  Therefore, I suggest we change this to <b><a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/wiki/ROC" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="ROC">ROC</a></b>.  That is also factually correct and anyone who doesn't know what ROC means can click the link.  Honestly, there isn't really a need to put ROC or Republic of China there at all but I'm hoping that putting ROC in will satisfy both ROC nationalists and sticklers for exactitude, and also that shouldn't bother anyone else since it makes it clear that it is Taiwan but also is correct.  Just like saying New York, USA.  It isn't really necessary to add USA to New York, since almost everyone knows that New York is in the USA but it is more exact.  Anyone with further problems should see: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(Chinese)" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)</a>.  I would also like to use as an example Korea.  Costco says it has stores in <b>Korea</b>.  Yet we put <b>South Korea</b> here.  The reason is to avoid confusion and make it clear that although Costco just says Korea, they really mean South Korea.  We also didn't put <b><a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">ROK</a></b> (Republic of Korea) because very few people know that ROK is the official name of South Korea.  So, again, I hope everyone can be happy with <b><a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/wiki/ROC" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="ROC">ROC</a></b> because it is both factual and easy to understand and I can't see any reason to object to it.  <a href="/wiki/User:Fanra" title="User:Fanra">Fanra</a> 19:23, 13 May 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Technically, ROC refers to ALL of China, and so does PRC. The choice between the 2 is a matter of which government you recognize. "Taiwan" is more accurate because it is purely a geographic designation and is politically neutral. BTW, Puerto Rico is not part of the United States. It is a territory of the United States. If you were in London and someone asked you where you are from and you said "the United States," when you're actually from Puerto Rico, they would get the wrong idea.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Bostoner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bostoner (page does not exist)">Bostoner</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bostoner" title="User talk:Bostoner">talk</a>) 23:51, 3 September 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>After I reverted someone deleting the holiday closures, CoolCaesar made a good point as to why it is there. Perhaps it was already discussed, but I don't recall. Anyway, Costco is the only major national retailer who is still closed on all those holidays. Years ago, most retailers were, but as time went on things changed towards being open. Because this is so out of the ordinary, it deems mention. And as a practical matter, it will help a great number of people who may otherwise make a trip to Costco on one of those days, only to have wasted their time and gasoline (not to metion polluting the air). <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> 18:33, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

<p>Both Sam's and Costco (as well as other defunct/merged chains) had these restrictions in the USA until around 1999-2001. Original idea was that qualified folks were less likely to write bad checks, shoplift or vandalize stuff. BJ's claimed that they were the only club that welcomed everyone to join as late as their 1998 annual report.

<dl><dd>Not sure. I've seen it before elsewhere. Is there a program that can find text strings? Anyway, absent any claims, I have no problem with it, and this is really good detailed info.

If you have something new to offer, of course, please do; but I'm guessing every possible issue has already been beaten to death five times over.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I've seen stuff I've done elsewhere copied onto WP and am fine with that, as I never "copyrighted" it in the first place. "Official" policy may seem otherwise, but policy means different things to different people, just as you can have 3 Christians read the same Bible verse and tell you it means 3 different things.

<p>Says who? Please don't cite some "official policy," as I've described above. None of us can just always assume that we are correct, and if everyone erred on the side of caution, nothing would ever get done. You delete a lot of stuff, usually citing some policy, but everything is subjective, even those policies themselves can be edited. There's no reason to delete a bunch of detailed info because there is a chance that it may infringe on someone. This isn't the same as a court of law where the injured party must come forward and prove his/her case, but common sense still does apply. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elpablo69" title="User talk:Elpablo69">talk</a>) 04:47, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

<p>Matt, I sit by as you delete a ton of stuff and make all sorts of changes which I (and of course others, like the ones involved) don't necessarily agree with. You are excellent at citing policies to back up your positions, but that doesn't mean you are right. People read things differently, and policies themselves change, and there are probably other policies that would seem to conflict. If you believe this is an issue, take the active roll and contact the website in question for further detail. However, please refrain for "erring with caution" before you find the answer.

<p>Article sections are completely unsupported and should not be in there.  First, American Express and its Costco customers are not in the same position at this date, compared to previously.  Many credit limits have been slashed or canceled for employees and customers, due to problems at American Express.  And obviously the claim of 'low profit margins' requires supporting statistics.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ykral&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ykral (page does not exist)">Ykral</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ykral" title="User talk:Ykral">talk</a>) 11:11, 19 February 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>Not sure I understand 100% what you are saying. Credit limits at all companies have been slashed to various extents for various customers. Low profit margins is a well-known fact, heck, it's been run into the ground so far its probably almost to China by now. Do some research, and then tell me what more could you possibly want in terms of "supporting statistics?" <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elpablo69" title="User talk:Elpablo69">talk</a>) 03:00, 24 February 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>The phrase 'low profit margins' is relative and not supported by any comparisons to other businesses.  Re American Express, the card has become notorious for its recent treatment of customers as noted in the New York Times.  Sadly, Costco members and staff were affected.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ykral&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ykral (page does not exist)">Ykral</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ykral" title="User talk:Ykral">talk</a>) 12:56, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
</p><p>Profit margins of the big three clubs are low when compared to other retailers. Sam's, Costco and BJ's have average gross margin of 9-12%. This is a well known fact. Costco even has a limit of 15% on any item, meaning that no item anywhere in the club is more than 15% above what Costco paid for it. While Sam's and BJ's don't have such a published rule, it would still be pretty unusual to find something above 15%. 
</p><p>Costco and BJ's are independent, public owned companies, and all of their financials are available for public review. Because Wal-Mart does not break out Sam's numbers to the same degree, not quite as much detail is available for them; however the numbers Wal-Mart does provide for Sam's show a great deal about their business, and it all indicates much of the same.
</p><p>There are plenty of other publicly owned retailers that anyone can compare their profit margins to. Plenty of academic and news outlets have done just that. And the result is that the clubs have much lower margins. So I must say that it is most definately backed up.
</p><p>As for Amex, I agree they kinda suck right now. But remember that nowdays lots of banks issue Amex, most notably Citi and BofA. So its easy for people (even news outlets) to confuse Amex-issued cards, and cards issued by banks which have the Amex logo on them. From my personal experience, I have Amex and Mastercard from Citi and they are pulling the same BS as did Amex with my Amex-issued cards.
</p><p>In both cases, I don't understand why either of this conditions would make you want to delete all mentions.

<p>Costco is in the process of settling a class action suit about their policy of charging full price for a membership renewal made after the membership has expired, but only extending the membership period till the original expiration date.  I.e. you pay for a year, but only get 6 months of membership.  The case is: <b>Rhonda Dupler v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, No. 06-CV-03141 (JFB) (ETB) (United States Court, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_District_of_New_York" class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern District of New York">Eastern District of New York</a>)</b>.

What Costco is agreeing to do is twofold: 1) Give some free membership extensions to people who purchased renewals under the old policy, and 2) Change the policy to only apply to renewals made less than 2 months after expiration, and publicize this policy more widely than they had done previously.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/deal-discussion/921384/">FatWallet.com</a>, a web forum, has a thread discussing the settlement.

<dl><dd>And yet the full outdoor garden/nursery center exists at 5901 Redwood Drive Rohnert Park, CA 94928.

<p>To become a Costco member in the UK, you either have to be in the trade or you have to work in one of a <i>very</i> limited number of occupations (mostly public sector i.e. government employment), which would probably exclude (at a guess) 90 to 95 per cent of the British population from shopping at Costco.

<p>This is great! Thanks for finding this article. It should be noted there is a giant loophole that will allow any British resident to be a member: sign up for membership in the USA. A Costco card issued by any country is valid worldwide, and the USA has no restrictions. You can pay the renewal fee at any Costco worldwide, without having to re-qualify for membership. The British resident does not have to travel to USA, as Costco will let you sign up online and they will mail your card to you. The only possible issue would be will Costco mail it to a UK address? If not, simply have it mailed to a friend in the USA and have them forward it to you in the UK. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elpablo69" title="User talk:Elpablo69">talk</a>) 17:33, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

<p>An editor brings up a valid point that the demo employees are paid less and get less benefits, and he cited a good article from 2008.
</p><p>However, there are 3 major flaws with the cited material:
</p><p>1. Things have changed since the article was written in 2008:
</p><p>-Sam's fired all of their demo employees and now uses an outside company which pays less and offers less benefits.
</p><p>-Costco demo employees now mostly make ***COSTCO*** MINIMUM WAGE ($11/hour), and then get small raises each year thereafter. COSTCO minimum wage of $11/hour should not be compared to the LEGAL minimum wage of $7.25/hour (federal). Demo employee raises still lag way behind Costco employee raises. It would take "forever" for a demo employee to reach the current Costco top wage of $21/hour for non-supervisory hourly workers.
</p><p>2. The article had numerous errors even at the time of publication:
</p><p>-Sam's has never offered at 10% employee discount, rather a free Sam's card. Wal-Mart has an employee discount, and this author confused the two.
</p><p>-Costco does indeed hire demo workers to become Costco employees. They are not permitted to work for both companies at the same time, so they would have to quit CDS/WDS when the get hired at Costco.
</p><p>3. The article is from a liberal source, not a mainstream publication. 
</p><p>The way the WP entry was worded was biased. However, it is worth noting the facts. Let's come up with something accurate and objective to add to the article. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elpablo69" title="User talk:Elpablo69">talk</a>) 22:46, 8 January 2012 (UTC)

Anyway, type "Costco Fresh" into Google and this is result number 3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Costco-will-try-out-a-fresh-idea-in-Bellevue-1096916.php">http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Costco-will-try-out-a-fresh-idea-in-Bellevue-1096916.php</a> Plenty of other ref. material is available, showing that it garnered a lot of attention (at the time), hardly just a minor footnote.
</p><p>It got way past the thought stage, they had filed plans with the city (and the fact they had almost done this 3 years prior in NY. It shows willingness to test new concepts. A later article shows the CEO axed it because his top executives were spending "something like 50% of their time" on this one little concept store and distracting from the main warehouse business. This shows the companies nimbleness and willingness to jettison something if it gets too far out of control.
</p><p>I guess the real question is why some editor deleted the dead link, yet didn't just Google an updated link. Go figure! <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Elpablo69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Elpablo69 (page does not exist)">Elpablo69</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elpablo69" title="User talk:Elpablo69">talk</a>) 01:56, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The reason for axing the concept isn't in that seattlepi source - is there a second source? The existing source shows it gathered local community attention by a city planning agency and the regional newspaper, but nothing further is shown by that one source. From what I can find by Googling, other sources appear to be reprints of the seattlepi article.</dd>
<dd>Regardless, it never materialized, and any claims of "showing" or "demonstrating" something from the concept is better illustrated by the concepts that did materialize (ie: Business Center and Home). --- <a href="/wiki/User:Barek" title="User:Barek">Barek</a> <small>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Barek" title="User talk:Barek">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barek" title="Special:Contributions/Barek">contribs</a>)</small> - 02:27, 18 May 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>The following text was removed by <a href="/wiki/User:Dr.K." title="User:Dr.K.">User:Dr.K.</a> as "Badly written with spelling mistakes and there is no criticism against Costco directly". costco reacted meanwhile, as others did, so costco had a certain notability with this, i for example only know they exist because of this topic. it should be in the article therefor. 
</p>
<dl><dd>In 2014, the guardian reported, that Costco is client of <a href="/wiki/Charoen_Pokphand_Foods" title="Charoen Pokphand Foods">Charoen Pokphand Foods</a>. During 6 months the guardian traced down the whole chain from slave ships in asian waters to leading producers and retailers. <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd>So what? Costco was not criticised directly. They didn't report that Costco was in any way responsible or ought to know. This article is about Costco, not its suppliers or their practices. In  addition other chains were mentioned such as Walmart etc. That doesn't mean we have to go to their articles and mention that somewhere in their supply chain there was a slavery connection, especially if unbeknownst to them. Also Costco commented something to the effect that they were going to rectify the matter. <a href="/wiki/User:Dr.K." title="User:Dr.K.">Δρ.Κ.</a>&#160;<small><sup style="position:relative"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dr.K." title="User talk:Dr.K.">λόγος</a><span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-5.2ex;*left:-5.5ex"><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dr.K." title="Special:Contributions/Dr.K.">πράξις</a></span></sup></small> 22:57, 15 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>ah, yes you are right, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.costco.com/disclosure-regarding-human-trafficking-and-anti-slavery.html">it replied directly here, titled "anti-slavery"</a>, with: "In 1999 Costco adopted a supplier Code of Conduct and revised the Code as recently as 2010....

</p>
<dl><dd>I agree to include a "Slavery policy" section explaining how it came about and what the policy of Costco is regarding the slavery issue. But the section should not be called "criticism" because noone directly criticised Costco or Walmart or other involved chain. <a href="/wiki/User:Dr.K." title="User:Dr.K.">Δρ.Κ.</a>&#160;<small><sup style="position:relative"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dr.K." title="User talk:Dr.K.">λόγος</a><span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-5.2ex;*left:-5.5ex"><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Dr.K." title="Special:Contributions/Dr.K.">πράξις</a></span></sup></small> 05:57, 16 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>agreed. the article table of contents is kind of flat, which was the reason i put a header on top of things which somehow needed governance actions. if "criticism" is not good, what would be an appropriate heading? --<a href="/wiki/User:ThurnerRupert" title="User:ThurnerRupert">ThurnerRupert</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ThurnerRupert" title="User talk:ThurnerRupert">talk</a>) 00:21, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

<p>There is lots of press coverage showing that Costco has been trying for four years to get into France and two years to get into Iceland, but as with the Spain warehouses, they appear to be encountering one delay after another. That's not surprising, since local retailers know that they will get run over by Costco.  We should pull out the speculation for now, as well as the reference pointing to the Spain Web site as essentially saying "coming soon" (since Costco has finally opened its first two warehouses there).  We can always add that information back in whenever France and Iceland warehouses finally open. --<a href="/wiki/User:Coolcaesar" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Coolcaesar" title="User talk:Coolcaesar">talk</a>) 21:46, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
