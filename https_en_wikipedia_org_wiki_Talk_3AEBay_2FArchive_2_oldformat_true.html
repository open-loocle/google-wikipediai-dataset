<p>Made a change earlier, which got reverted.  Acquisitions section contains lines "for US $50 million", "for $150 million", "for $635 Million USD".  How about some consistency?
</p><p>$xxx USD is plain wrong. I'd prefer working with USD, GBP, EUR etc pp. Also, need to rethink 1x10^6 = 1 Million ... so what constitutes 1 Billion? british/us american? should there be used abbreviations?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Auction_Video">Auction Video</span></h2>
<p>I had the following: "The default provider of streaming video onto eBay is Auction Video <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.auctionvideo.com/">[1]</a>. DMRevolution <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dmrevolution.com/AM0000005.aspx">[2]</a> also legally provides this service. That means if one wants to film a homemade or professional commercial with a webcam or video camera, and place it on eBay, he or she must go through one of these companies."  This is all true, and not a salespitch for "a related product", but a encyclopedic reference to the actual provider of all videos for eBay.  The other external links were upsells, but this wasn't, so by no logic could have been deleted.  I think it's an important thing to know, especially as eBay continues rolling it out to the public. Anyone have any idea why this was deleted? If not I'd ask someone (myself if you're agreeable) to put it back up.  <a href="/wiki/User:Mrcolj" title="User:Mrcolj">Mrcolj</a> 16:28, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
</p>
<ul><li>Well, the DMRevolution link is to a specific seller's "webstore", so is inappropriate; and neither of those links back up the assertion that those are the sole providers of streaming video. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 17:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sorry, I didn't realize that would seem askew.  The link on DMR is to "a corporate account" and NOT "a specific seller's webstore."  I just thought it had more than www.dmrevolution.com, since it has links to the catalog, etc.  But I'm fine with the root link.  And what proof can I provide that Auction Video is the default provider of video for eBay?  It is, you can call them, you can call eBay.  It'll be fun to research--just tell me what you need and I'll post it here.  <a href="/wiki/User:Mrcolj" title="User:Mrcolj">Mrcolj</a> 23:58, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul><li>Post me a link to any indication that Auction Video is the default provider -- and just as important, provide a link to any indication that your assertion that "he or she must go through one of these companies" is correct. It's the responsibility of an editor making an assertion to document the assertion. As far as "calling them" is concerned, uh, no. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 00:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The best I've found is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://coins.ebay.com/">http://coins.ebay.com/</a>, where, at the bottom right, is a link from eBay to Auction Video.  That's not a paid link, so that at least proves that eBay has some interest in supporting Auction Video. But barring eBay putting out a press release, I don't know what I can show you.  There are a ton of review sites, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.auctionsoftwarereview.com/item.asp?itemid=308#reviews">this</a>.  So how 'bout we take off default (albeit true), "must", and DMRevolution and leave it at "Auction Video is the official provider of streaming video for eBay.  That means if one wants to film a homemade or professional commercial with a webcam or video camera, and place it on eBay, he can do so through Auction Video's website."  Again, Auction Video is really the default (not the exclusive) provider of all video content on eBay, and Auction Video holds the pending patent for such (which is enforceable by law.)  They are not a "related tool" any more than PayPal is a related tool.  They are an officially endorsed promotion of eBay, rolled out prototypically to certain verticals, most visibly to eBay Coins and eBay Live.  Basically anyone who uses eBay Coins or eBay Live knows who Auction Video is.  Tell me what more I can get you and I'll try. <a href="/wiki/User:Mrcolj" title="User:Mrcolj">Mrcolj</a> 12:44, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul><li>What makes you think the link on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://coins.ebay.com">http://coins.ebay.com</a> is unpaid? For gosh sakes, it goes through doubleclick. Nothing -- not even Auction Video's own site -- indicates any "official" role; AV's site says  only that they're an eBay compatible application. There are several sites that provide the service (and there are few barriers to entry). --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 19:13, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span id="History_of_Ebay.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_Ebay?">History of Ebay?</span></h2>
<p>Why doesn't this article include the history of Ebay?  When was it founded?  What lead to the idea for ebay?  Who were the brains behind ebay?  What about the company that was ebay before it was ebay?  Ebay has a rich history, and it is a shame we aren't reading about it on wikipedia.
</p>
<ul><li>I do wish someone would insert such a thing. I've held back because it's too hard for me to separate original research (e.g., my own memories). --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 16:46, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>I'd like to see such a thing too, I came to this page looking for the history. --jimblackler</li></ul>
<ul><li>Someone's put up an origins and history now. Though it could be expanded to deal with the growth from 1997 to the present, or is that covered by the acquisitions section?</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't eBay start with a capital letter when it's the first word of a sentence, like every other word?

<h2><span id="First_Member.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Member?">First Member?</span></h2>
<p>Hello. Hope I'm doing this right. Does anyone know who the first member was on eBay? People who work for eBay don't count and it has to be after their public opening.
</p>
<ul><li>I've not been able to determine for sure whether anybody knows this, but indications are that nobody has any idea. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 18:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>I'm sure the e-bay database techs have an idea.  The answer is a simple 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid=1'.  Of course, that's kind of useless without access to their database.
</p>
<ul><li><ul><li>Well, not really. Look at the conditions the question asked: it has to be the first non-employee after public opening. There were lots of non-employees before the public opening. (And a lot of non-employee users became employees before the public opening.) --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 04:44, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>I removed the lines regarding the Feb 2005 price increase from the Profit and Transactions section as this is trivial and, at this point, probably irrelevant, and certainly doesn't belong anywhere near the beginning of the ebay article. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.19.173.27&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.19.173.27 (page does not exist)">24.19.173.27</a> 18:55, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginnings">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone know how/where ebay got its name?  I've read that it was Echo Bay, California, but this place doesn't seem to exist.  There is an Echo Bay, Canada in British Columbia, however.
</p>

<p>I think someone should rework the "fee avoidance" paragraph, since as described it can refer to the standard eBay seller practice of inflating the handling charge for relatively inexpensive items. Unless the shipping is something like an order of magnitude too high eBay does allow it and will not cancel reported auctions, so I feel that part is inaccurate as well. In the extreme cases eBay will cancel auctions.

Ebay has violated anti trust laws, gone beyond just a venue, and done something very illegal.  They now require that you use their service paypal to pay for auctions.  Ebay listed bidpay as their alternative as a trick because ebay forced bidpay out of business.<br />

<h2><span id="ebay_payment_monopoly.2C_might_need_editing"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="ebay_payment_monopoly,_might_need_editing">ebay payment monopoly, might need editing</span></h2>
<p>I wrote this:<br />
<br />
NPOV here:
</p>
<ul><li>When ebay was using billpay as a payment service to compete with paypal, it engaged in practices such as requiring all payment banners to be extremely tiny, requiring its online stores to only use billpay, forcing buyers to go through billpay as its checkout system, and changing seller options by themselves to force sellers to accept billpay.  For the first one, ebay made no excuse; for the others it claimed were technical glitches, of which the author of the book paypal wars argued were doubtful.  Later, when ebay bought paypal, it made explicit rules such as sellers who use paypal must accept credit cards, cannot require anything like quasi-cash, cannot make buyers pay for paypal's fees.  It also made a "safe payment policy," which banned all online payment systems (online payment systems are not the same thing as <a href="/wiki/Merchant_account" title="Merchant account">merchant accounts</a>) except its own, Paypal, and a company that only takes eChecks and only operates in Canada.  Paypal has responded in emails that even accepting such forms if the buyer offers it are against its policy.  <i>((for the last I can include headers of my email or upload screenshots to wikipedia as evidence--even if not evidence enough you can copy my exact question to ebay and see the same answer))</i></li></ul>
<p><br />
I don't know:
</p>
<ul><li>It has been argued that "safe payments" is a monopolistic practice because it has the safety flaws that: (1) The buyer has no way to recoup money if the seller takes money orders and does not delivery.  (2) Paypal may not refund a seller who rips them off if the seller's paypal account is empty and they have no bank account, removed their bank account, told their bank to block direct debit, told their bank to block paypal from direct debit, or changed their bank account after verifying. (3) Paypal allows buyers to make fraudulent claims to get refunds; it rarely fights chargebacks; and it has no option for sellers not to keep shipping costs.  Example paypal buyer scams include: any time a package is not tracked if a buyer says not delivered 100% of the time they get their money back; any not as described case has no option for a seller to provide their input; buyers can ship to the wrong address on purpose or use a remailer from the buyer's zipcode to ship to their address and claim the seller refused it when it was not delivered; if a buyer returns goods damaged in shipping paypal still gives a full refund; some buyers have shipped empty boxes back for return.  <i>((I have a seen news sources on the last one))</i></li></ul>
<p><br />
For the second, a list of paypal scams is good.  For the whole thing maybe <a href="/wiki/Weasel_word" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a> will fix it.  It was here or paypal that had whole sections changed constantly, so I don't know about adding "list of paypal scams--watch out!" as a section in <a href="/wiki/Paypal" class="mw-redirect" title="Paypal">paypal</a>.  Umm I wrote this to replace what I added earlier as "Some argue that eBay has pursued antitrust activities through Billpoint and then PayPal." and then I kind of wrote a lot.  <a href="/wiki/User:DyslexicEditor" class="mw-redirect" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 08:29, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
</p><p>You know, I've seen several people refer to eBay's monoplistic payment practices and to be honest I have no clue what you are talking about. eBay allows payments via PayPal, Check/Money Order, etc. To have a monopoly don't you enforce only one type of payment period? To be a monopoly eBay would basically have to say any payment type other than PayPal is banned. Since they don't how is that a monopoly?<a href="/wiki/User:Kaid" title="User:Kaid">Kaid</a> 11:37, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul><li>I'm trying to figure out in what way this hurts the buyer (as opposed to denying eBay some income.) Technically, I'd think it <i>helps</i> the buyer, since even those places that want to take sales tax don't tax S&amp;H, so the buyer pays less than they might otherwise. Of course, there's the risk that the buyer doesn't notice the shipping fee, but nowadays shipping fees are displayed right up there with the prices. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 18:56, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>It is possible that it could hurt the buyer if they need to return the item for a refund as some sellers may not refund the S&amp;H only the actual purchase price. I think that is also the case where insurance is paid out, only on the purchase price and not on the rest. <a href="/wiki/User:Kaid" title="User:Kaid">Kaid</a> 11:22, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span id=".22buyer_fraud.22_schemes"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="&quot;buyer_fraud&quot;_schemes">"buyer fraud" schemes</span></h2>
<p>Currently in the article under "Frauds committed by buyers include" are these two items:
</p>
<ul><li><i>Returning items in such insufficient packing that they are damaged and using paypal to force a refund</i></li>
<li><i>Using paypal to return an item not as described, using a remailer to ship from the seller's zip code to your home so it looks like the buyer rejected the item, and a rejected return according to numerous rules (including credit card companies and paypal) means a refund to the buyer for "good faith" at returning the item.</i></li></ul>
<p>The first one, as it stands, doesn't seem to make sense. You return an item in such a way that it gets damaged in shipping, and thereby you get a refund? If the seller is offering a refund, why does the item need to be damaged in shipping when you return it? If the seller isn't offering a refund, why would you get a refund if the item is damaged when he receives the returned item? In either case, why are you returning the item in the first place? And how do you guarantee that the item will be damaged, even if your packaging is insufficient? And why would anyone give you a refund if your packaging was obviously inadequate? And how does one "use paypal to force a refund"? Isn't that between the buyer/shipper and whatever shipping service he used?
</p><p>Phew. Moving on to the second item, After reading it about 6 times I think I get it, but what does it mean to use "paypal to return an item not as described"? Paypal isn't a shipping service. And how likely is it that a buyer will have a coconspirator who's able to ship from the seller's Zip code? And apparently this coconspirator also has an item to ship that's similar or identical to the item the buyer is buying? And the seller somehow doesn't detect, or can't prove to Paypal, that the item that was "returned" isn't the item that he sent? And how does the buyer "prove" to Paypal that he rejected delivery of the item?
</p><p>Both of these schemes sound like "Rube Goldberg Takes up eBay Fraud" <a href="/wiki/User:KarlBunker" class="mw-redirect" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 23:57, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Both include filing a "not as described" in paypal.  Paypal allows the seller to return them for a refund plus shipping, packing (even if buyer does not return packing material), and insurance.  The buyer just has to give paypal a tracking number.  Returning something so it gets broken is like mailing glass in an envelope.  The seller may not be offering a refund, the buyer just has to use paypal to force a refund.  Have you read paypal's policies?  See buyer complaint process in paypal--you sound to me like you have not used them.  Also, they don't need a conspirator, remailing services are actually regular businesses.  Remailers work by the buyer giving the envelope/package to the remailer and the remailer transports it to another location and puts it in the post office--it's a company thing.  Of course if a person ships to themselves they don't even need the item in the first place.  You seem confused about this (and I've seen many more confusing articles--many of them scientific with unusual vocabulary) so ask me if you do not understand this.  <a href="/wiki/User:DyslexicEditor" class="mw-redirect" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 14:16, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I've just reviewed eBay's and PayPal's policies, and I don't see anything there that makes it appear that these schemes are particularly practical, or much of a threat to sellers. I don't deny that something like them is <i>possible,</i> just that there doesn't seem to be any real loophole in the policies that an unscrupulous buyer can easily take advantage of. There's no indication that eBay or PayPal have automated processes to handle such situations; they both talk about disputed cases being reviewed by human beings, so I don't see how there's any reason to assume that such a dispute would automatically be resolved in favor of the buyer.</dd>
<dd>The descriptions are also very unclear, even after your further explanation. Is it the purpose of returning something in inadequate packaging--so that it's likely to be damaged--to disguise the fact that the buyer isn't returning the item he was sent? If so, that seems like a precarious and unrealistic scheme. And I still don't get the reasoning behind a buyer having a fake item shipped to him from the seller's Zip code. If eBay is able to track down the paper trail of the false shipment, they'd presumably also find the paper trail of the real shipment.</dd>

<ul><li>I am curious about a couple of things.
<ol><li><i>eBay has pursued anti-trust activities</i> -- really? I thought that was the job of the Department of Justice, not that they've been doing it recently.</li>
<li><i>users have no privacy in regard to the items that they have purchased.</i> Since when is the a controversy? The entire seller/buyer trust system is based upon open feedback, and has been since the invention of feedback in the first year or so of eBay; and you don't need to see a buyer's feedback to know their buying history -- you can just search buy buyer ID and get their buying and bidding record for the last couple months (depending upon how recently eBay has aged the accounts). The actual controversy about feedback is the opposite -- it's possible for sellers to set up "private auctions", so you don't know who their customers are, and the resulting feedback is not linked to the item; this is considered something of a dodge by a lot of observers, because it's a way to conceal some sneaky tricks like shill bidding from the general public (though of course eBay knows who s who).</li></ol></li>

<p><i>Currently, eBay forbids sellers from accepting the services of independent money-wiring companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram. Cash-payments, too, are prohibited.</i>
i'm pretty sure such payment methods are allowed its just sellers aren't allowed to require them. <a href="/wiki/User:Plugwash" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 11:11, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It appears to be correct. See the reference I added to that statement in the article. <a href="/wiki/User:KarlBunker" class="mw-redirect" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 11:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>In fact, eBay forbids sellers from accepting cash payments, or any "wire" money-transfer services. If they find that a seller is accpeting any such payment, they will end his or her listing.
</p><p>I think that it is controversial that people cannot buy products on eBay without being forced to let others know what they have purchased. Barring your mentioned "private auctions," a buyer -- if rated -- has absolutely no way of concealing his purchasing habits. Personally, I think it's be fine for users to be able to see "ratings" (positive or negative) and comments, but it wouldn't kill me if there were no link to the item(s) in question.<small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Commando303&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Commando303 (page does not exist)">Commando303</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Commando303" title="User talk:Commando303">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Commando303" title="Special:Contributions/Commando303">contribs</a>) 04:01, April 9, 2006  (UTC)</small>

<dl><dd>But there's no reason why an eBay username should reveal a person's "real" identity. Nor (afaik) is there anything preventing someone from having multiple eBay usernames.

<p>My opinion is my opinion, and I understand that. I accept that this fact about eBay might not have a place on Wikipedia, and thus I have not tried to pursue placing it on the site. That said, it's not nearly so simple as "if you don't like eBay, don't use it; no one's holding a gun to your head." The fact of the matter is that, realistically, if I wish to sell something to a large, international audience, I have no (again, realistic) <i>choice</i> but to use eBay's services. It might be nice if I had the option of turning to other large companies, that had a strong command over the online-auction market, but none seem to exist to rival eBay; further, eBay sees fit to ensure that it remain without any serious comptetition. It might be argued that eBay is, indeed, a business, and that any business will attempt to make as much money as possible, but that does not equate people's "having to be OK with such a situation"; that is, having to be OK with a situation wherein they have no real choice in which company to purchase services from.
</p><p>So, I understand that eBay's not allowing users to hide their purchases might not have a place on Wikipedia (I still feel that it wouldn't hurt to have that stated on the site, but, whatever; it's not something I'm set to argue about), but regarding my "choice" in not using eBay, it's not a real "choice"; it's an idealistic, impractical alternative. <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Commando303&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Commando303 (page does not exist)">Commando303</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Commando303" title="User talk:Commando303">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Commando303" title="Special:Contributions/Commando303">contribs</a>) 05:47, April 15, 2006  (UTC)</small>

<ul><li>(a)Please sign your posts. (b) <i>I wish to sell something to a large, international audience, I have no (again, realistic) </i>choice<i> but to use eBay's services</i> -- well, if you're concerned with "hiding purchases", that's pretty irrelevant, for two reasons: first of all, you're not purchasing; and second, if you're selling and concerned about your customers privacy, then you can make it a "private auction" and the bidders identities will be secret. (c) Even so, the privacy issue is pretty trivial, if not utterly meaningless. Neither buyers nor sellers need to identify themselves with any information available to the general public. All I need to do is create an account linked to my email address -- say, "jpgebay@gmail.com", just inventing a name out of the blue; then I come up with a userid to use on ebay -- say, FuddyDuddyNitPicker -- and nobody need know it's the guy who also calls himself jpgordon on Wikipedia bidding on those controversial items. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 14:25, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>I don't know how to "sign my posts."
</p><p>The ability to conceal purchases does not affect me very much as a seller; indeed, even as a buyer, with my purchases, <i>I</i> generally don't care very much whether anyone sees what I've bought or does not. I do think that, as a buyer, it would be nice for me to have the ability of not revealing to the world what I've bought, but, again, as this isn't a very stressed personal concern for me, I see no reason to push for its statement on Wikipedia. Regarding "privatizing" listings, I understand that, as a seller, I have the ability to do this. Further, I understand that my user ID probably won't be a direct reflection of who I am, but, certainly, I can imagine a situation wherein people I know know my user ID; they may then use simply my ID to track what I've bought and haven't bought, whether I wish they be able to do this or do not wish they be able to. I don't see this as a serious offense, but I did see it as enough of an issue to be taken notice of. Once again, however, I have no intention of changing it, or "making it objective," so to push for its placement on this Web site.
</p>
<ul><li>As it says on the very first line of this page, <b>Please sign your comments using four tildes (~~~~).</b>. Regarding the rest, if you think it's enough of an issue to be taken notice of, find a reliable source that's taken issue with it. Oh, and if you as a buyer later decide you'd rather be more private, that's easy too: open another account. eBay has no rule against having multiple accounts as long as they aren't for the purpose of fraud. Many eBay members use one account for buying and another for selling, for a number of reasons (for example, they might not want their potential buyers to know how much they bought the thing for in the first place). Some sellers have multiple accounts just to make their bookkeeping easier; for example, they might use one just to sell comics and another to sell car parts; or, more to the point, one to sell beanie babies and another to sell dirty movies. Members who are active on the eBay discussion forums often have a userid they use solely on the boards. It is the case that few years ago, a lot of users simply used their email address and didn't even have a userid, but eBay now requires non-email userids. However, when email addresses were allowed, and were easily accessible, it was indeed seen as a privacy concern -- so much so that in some countries (Germany comes to mind) eBay had to turn off search-by-bidder. Now snooping's a lot harder; you can only get the email address tied to a userid if you're doing business with them. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 18:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>Sorry about not catching the part at the top about signatures; I'll be sure to sign my posts from now on.
</p><p>About your recommendation for opening multiple accounts, are you sure that doing so isn't against eBay's policy? I'd assume that, with more than one account, there would be little stopping someone from driving up the prices of his or her own auctions; hell, one wouldn't even need a "reserve price": one could just swoop in at the last moment, and place a bid price for which one wouldn't be willing to sell less than. I'm actually aware of the "e-mail address IDs"; I started out with one, and was eventually forced, by eBay, to change it to something else. One thing I've found annoying about contacting users through eBay now, is related to what appears to be a "glitch" in eBay's system: I've tried multiple times to contact a buyer (using the "contact member" button) about something after an auction's end (he didn't win the auction), and eBay states that I have already used my "daily limit" of "contacts." This happens every time I try to contact a particular few members; other IDs seem unaffected by it. I've also run into quite a few glitches ("page not responding" type things) when trying to contact eBay about boot-legged items, customer service, etc. I get that a big site is bound to have problems, but I wish eBay's problems were addressed by its staff in a more timely manner. Anyway, thanks for the info. about the legality of multiple accounts.

<ul><li>Yes, I am sure having multiple accounts does not violate policy, as long as it is not for the purpose of fraud. The bidding practice you describe is quite against the rules, and is also illegal in many jurisdictions. eBay calls it "shilling", and uses automated tools to detect it. (I wrote the early versions of "shillhunter", so I'm intimately familar with the issue, as well as with the detection process.) --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a> 15:47, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>I've qualified some statements with "ebay.com" or "US-based eBay" because ebay rules vary considerably depending on the country. I did not check ebay.com policies as I expect most editors
are US based and have probably checked them already, but ebay.co.uk and ebay.sg currently allow different payment methods than ebay.com. eBay's policies and fees also vary according to country.

<p>Sorry to say this, but this is true. EBay is run by a bunch of incompetent morons.
They do not know a single thing like to withdraw money from my account.
I have my account set up so if I pay, the money is taken dirrectly from my account.
Yet they kept sending me a message saying the account is overdue. I was responding with a message saying to withdraw the money from my bank.
However, they did not know how to do this and kept sending me the same message over and over again.
Now I found out my account has been suspended for being late with my payment.
How dumb a person has to be not to be able to withdraw the money directly from my account, considering they had done it many times before (last time at the end of April) and they had all the information needed?
As I said it before, EBay is run by a bunch of morons.

</p>
<blockquote><p>*Under its Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) policy<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/programs-vero-ov.html">[4]</a>, eBay permits intellectual property holders (such as software manufacturers) to directly close auctions where its products are being resold. Though the <a href="/wiki/First_sale_doctrine" class="mw-redirect" title="First sale doctrine">first sale doctrine</a> permits the resale of such licenses, and a court in California where eBay is based upheld it in the case of <a href="/wiki/Softman_v._Adobe" class="mw-redirect" title="Softman v.

<p>First of all, the citation is six years old, which isn't too useful, especially since Softman came after it. Also, VeRO is primarily used for stopping piracy and trademark infractions, as opposed to preventing resale; the paragraph gives the idea that resale is the primary issue.

<dl><dd>In principle VeRO is for stopping piracy, trademark and copyright violations; in practice it is used by many companies to effectively prevent resale. There are frequent posts on the eBay Discussion Boards from sellers who are selling legitmately purchased products on eBay that have had their listings shut down because the company didn't want their brand sold on eBay. Here are some examples: <b>Vittoria North America, L.L.C.</b>: "Unfortunately, in order to protect our Trademark, we have been forced to eliminate all Vittoria products from the eBay website." <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/HallOfShame/Vittoria/emails/emailFromWaller20031117a.html">1</a> <b>Ojon Corporation</b>: "We do not want our products being bought or auctioned on ebay.

<dl><dd>They are seeking to prevent all sales <i>on eBay</i>. Other sites are rarely mentioned. If you look at the letters quoted above, some manufacturers believe, among other things, that selling on eBay cheapens their brand and damages their reputation, therefore their items may never be sold on eBay. I have seen more than one manufacturer site that states their items may never be sold on eBay, and that they will have any listings removed if they find their brand being sold on eBay. I can rustle up some of those links tomorrow if you like. <a href="/wiki/User:MonaLS" title="User:MonaLS">MonaLS</a> 06:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

One thing I'm wondering is could a website like eBay (user database, html-programmed user pages, etc.) be programmed using only Java?-<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:TAz69x&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:TAz69x (page does not exist)">TAz69x</a> 20:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've bought several items from eBay that have taken over two months to arrive. But I still almost always leave positive feedback because I don't want to bother risking getting into feedback disputes. The only time I've left neutral feedback was when I found out that the item had only been <b>sent</b> over a month after I had paid for it. <a href="/wiki/User:JIP" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:JIP" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think his (or her) point is merely the impetus on eBay [i]not[/i] to leave negative feedback for others, lest one receive a response in kind. This, as has been said, can work against eBay's system of "points," as the scores people have are likely not to reflect their actual reliability as sellers or buyers.

<dl><dd>How about, perhaps, a split between eBay-the-company and eBay-the-website?

<p>I saw mention of this particular problem in some old versions, but it never stayed. I am working a well-worded addition as I speak (with references). This is that annoying situation where various feedback 'Vendors' sell $.01 JPEGs to inflate the feedback of 0-feedback 'Grafter' buyers.
</p><p>Then, once the grafter reaches a feedback of 15 or so, they post a very expensive item for sale, then defraud the poor buyer that falls for it. Vendors can purchase more freedback from other Vendors, and have near-perfect feedback in the tens of thousands as a result.

<dl><dd>OK, good, you have a reliable source that it's <i>possible</i>. That makes it interesting. That source doesn't indicate it's a "major problem", just that it happens (or even that it can happen; I can't find anything on the mentioned Fortinet site about the matter, though I didn't look too hard.) --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 23:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>It's near the bottom of the Fortinet site, so I thought referencing a cleaner written article would be wiser. Plus, the articles I linked are static, versus Fortinet which probably gets updated. As for it being a major problem, that comes from firsthand research into Ebay's forums. There were quite a few posts about people having this happen to them, but there are very many links to cite. Should I just link to the largest thread on the topic? You can see the dilemma with that. --SRB
