<p>Ebay is taking the right of having private feedbacks away from sellers as of 10/26. You will not be able to list an item to sell if your feedbacks are private. eBay has not bothered to notifiy sellers of this.

<ul><li>Oh excellent. I always <i>hated</i> the idea that sellers could have secret feedback. If I remember right, the "private feedback" policy started when it was eBay's policy that feedback could never be removed. I do wonder how you can say "without notifying sellers", though, since today is October 5th, it takes effect on the 26th, and you linked us to exactly where they are giving such notice.

</p><p>In the "Other Controversies" section it states that "eBay discourages sellers from using independent money-wiring companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram". I assume that this was added as people feel that this discourages competition for eBay's payment service, PayPal. If that is the case would this still be the case if that is not the reason it is discouraged? Both WU and MoneyGram discourage the use of their services on eBay as well: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/mrkt_safety/instantcashtransfer.html#western">http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/mrkt_safety/instantcashtransfer.html#western</a> If this is not the reason that this is considered controversial could someone clarify this? <a href="/wiki/User:Kaid" title="User:Kaid">Kaid</a> 16:07, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Frequency_of_fraud">Frequency of fraud</span></h2>
<p>During I think it was about 2003, a new MMORPG, Eve-Online, started.
</p><p>I spent about six months playing, during which time I learned how to make a lot of in-game currency, which I was then selling on ebay.
</p><p>A small number of other people were also engaged in this activity, and we got an idea of who was who through the ebay listings.
</p><p>We found that fraudenlent buyers were a *major* problem.  Buyers would pay with stolen credit cards and it would only be later that the payment would be recognized as fraudent.  With Paypal in particular this was a major problem, since Paypal then billed the seller for the fraudent payment and because Paypal exlude virtual goods from their insurance programme.  With other forms of payment (Western Union on-line money transfers, for example) this wasn't a problem because WU would honour the payment once it was made.
</p><p>As a result, I began to track *all* the sales of ISK (the in-game currency) for a period of about two months.
</p><p>It turned out to be very easy to spot a fraudent buyer.  They would bid over the going rate and they would often bid on many auctions concurrently.  This was of course because they weren't spending their own money and because they wanted to get as much ISK as possible before the card was detected as invalid.
</p><p>There was only *one* case of a more sophisticated fraud, who built up a +5 reputation before going on a fraud spree.  He did well, because ebay at that time only showed the current rating, which for him of course was only going down by -1 each time someone gave a negative feedback that he'd defrauded them.  (From that episode, I learned to always check the full user history).
</p><p>What I found was that about *HALF* of all bidders were fraudulent.
</p><p>I emailed one seller who lost the equivelent of 3000 dollars of in-game currency.
</p><p>I think this information is quite interesting and I wish/intend to add it to the Ebay page.
</p><p>Any comments/suggestions?

Having spent countless hours in some of eBay's chat rooms, I've found that the matter of lack of accessibility is a sore subject for many -- especially newbies. For the most part, eBay veterans are accustomed to it and find the chat rooms themselves to be the best available workaround, but it doesn't mean that they like it.   Additionally, there is <i>Live Help</i>, which offers real time assistance via chat.  I've used it quite a few times and have generally found it useful; others have not had that experience.  The topic itself is not inappropriate to the article, although I agree that the link to the petition page is of dubious value.</dd>

<p>[<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://watches777.blogspot.com/">[4]</a>]Actually Ebay will side with the Buyers every single time, i have been a platinum seller since 2004 and i have lost every dispute, to say the truth i only answer the disputes so Ebay would not say i did not show any interest in helping solve the issue,because i know they just side with the buyers! Why? because Ebay does not have any control over the buyer, but it SURELY does over the seller!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feedback_abuse">Feedback abuse</span></h2>
<p><b>Feedback abuse:</b>
</p><p>A practice among some sellers is to hold feedback hostage. Even though the buyer paid promptly, the seller refuses to leave feedback.
A further abuse of this is that some sellers deliberately withhold feedback so that if a customer is not satisfied with a purchase, no matter how legitimate their reason is, the seller may then use their feedback for malicious retaliation against the buyer, intentionally damaging their feedback score and reputation, and thus, their buying and selling ability, as buyers and sellers both often rely on the feedback score in deciding whether or not to do business with a particular individual.

<b>"some eBay members choose not to leave feedback"</b>
These are word-for-word quotes directly from Ebay, which acknowledges that the problem does exist.
<b>Source: Ebay - Direct word-for-word quotes</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>I have added citations for a couple of third-party sources that examine eBay's feedback weaknesses, and added a cite from eBay's own policy pages for good measure (<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EBay&amp;diff=140525717&amp;oldid=140524189">diff</a>).

<dl><dd>I should also add that just citing eBay's policies alone is not good enough - just because they say "don't use retaliatory feedback" doesn't mean there actually is a problem with it (that would be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">drawing your own conclusion</a> from incomplete evidence). To draw an analogy, most countries have laws against murder, but that does not mean all those countries have problems with high murder rates.

<p>This is the latest change from Ebay about feedback policies.
</p><p>The eBay Feedback system was designed to provide a simple, honest, accurate record of member experiences. Focusing on customer service includes doing everything we can to grow customer confidence in our sellers.
</p>
<ul><li>Buyers will only be able to receive positive Feedback.</li>
<li>Positive repeat customer Feedback will count (up to 1 Feedback from the same buyer per week.)</li>
<li>Feedback more than 12-months old won't count towards your Feedback percentage.</li>
<li>When a buyer doesn't respond to the Unpaid Item (UPI) process the negative or neutral Feedback they have left for that transaction will be removed.</li>
<li>When a member is suspended, all their negative and neutral Feedback will be removed.</li>
<li>Buyers must wait 3 days before leaving negative or neutral Feedback for sellers with an established track record, to encourage communication.</li>
<li>All Feedback must be left within 60 days (compared to 90 days today) of listing end to encourage timely Feedback and discourage abuse.</li>
<li>Buyers will be held more accountable when sellers report an unpaid item or commit other policy violations.</li></ul>

<p>Not all of us spend all our lives on the computer, and think it reasonable to have a telephone number and correspondence address for eBay to resolve problems. My problem started when out of the blue I received a letter fro a debt collector, stating their client eBay &amp; some reference number that didn’t make any sense to me. I paid the money since I don’t like threats of legal action over me. The money has now been refunded by the debt collector.
</p><p>The facts are that when I sent an email to eBay using their link to a message box, it  bounced back. Other emails were replied to with a questionnaire to which my problem didn’t match any of their “tick boxes”. Other replies were of the brain dead type.
</p><p>The point is I think it quite reasonable to have a correspondence address &amp; telephone number to sort out problems. There’s something wrong with a company which doesn’t like giving out their address &amp; only has a premium rate number, linked to some section of eBay I’m not interested in.
</p><p>Anyway I was given eBay’s address in Europe from the debt collector in good faith as:
</p><p>eBay Europe SARL,
The Atrium Building
Old Navan Rd
Blancharstown
Dublin 15
Ireland
</p><p>The sensible thing would be for one user of wikipedia to check this out. if it is proved correct then it should included in the Customer care section of Ebay on the main pages. I did this but someone took it off, stating vandalism or some other nonsense.

<dl><dd>I agree. So far as I can tell, the transaction was legal. While tragic in its context, there isn't anything necessarily <i>controversial</i> about the purchase from eBay's perspective.

<p>OK, now there's another "controversy". An editor has inserted this:
</p>
<blockquote><p>* In November 2007, eBay began <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://survey.ebay.com/survey/ebay/eby07030/us">this survey</a> of which one of the things it was about was forcing sellers to automatically leave positive feedback for buyers if the buyers paid quickly, making the sellers lose feedback privileges.</p></blockquote>
<p>I removed it, asking in what way it's a controversy. It's not even a statement of policy; it's asking a question; there's no indication any policy change is in order. So, there might be a <i>debate</i> (not that the insertion points to any such debate), but controversy? --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 06:16, 20 November 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<ul><li>I re-removed the feedback concern. If eBay was currently forcing sellers to leave positive feedback if they were immediately paid I could see this as a controversial issue.

<ul><li>Nah. It's a lot more complicated than that. eBay (and prior to that, AuctionWeb) was originally in Perl, but by 1997 ( or so), the site was so heavily visited that it gained a reputation as the world's slowest website. It was rewritten completely, in C++, right before I arrived there. It was a huge fight to build scalability into the system, and at the time I left (in 2002) the fight was still going on. Probably still is, though exponential growth doesn't seem to be occurring anymore.

<blockquote>
<p>The state of Pennsylvania has shut down the eBay business of Mary Jo Pletz, who started the endeavor so she could earn money at home while caring for her 6-month-old daughter, who had developed a brain tumor.
</p><p>Pletz launched her business in 2004, when she realized she couldn't work full time because of Julia's medical tests and doctors visits. Her business, D&amp;J Virtual Consignment, had 11,000 feedback comments on eBay and 14 were negative, Pletz said, giving her a 99.9 percent satisfaction rating. A few days after Christmas 2006, the state investigator drove up. She recalls his warning that the state was "drawing a line in the sand."
Her crime? Selling goods on the Internet without an "auctioneer's license."
</p><p>She cooperated with the government and shut down her successful business. However, not content with merely running her out of business, state officials are also prosecuting her, with a potential penalty of $1,000 per violation.
</p><p>After shutting down her auction business, Pletz went back to work as a dental hygienist. Because of the complaint, Pletz worries the state also could revoke her dental hygienist's license, which she earned by attending community college for seven years at night.

</p>
<ul><li><ul><li>I was thinking controversy. This is the first time I've heard of someone getting in trouble with the law and hasn't violated any eBay rules. You can only get one feedback per sale, and not everyone leaves feedback, so she is looking at a minimum of a elven million dollar fine. I believe it is encyclopedic because it does not just effect eBay, but anyone that sells online. What if all eBay sellers had to get auctioneer's licenses? --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/75.181.81.73" title="Special:Contributions/75.181.81.73">75.181.81.73</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:75.181.81.73&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:75.181.81.73 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:36, 2 February 2008 (UTC)
<ul><li>In what way is it a controversy? Pennsylvania has a law which is sporadically enforced, and their legislature is considering changing it, and one eBay seller is getting messed up. Do you have any good sources describing this as a controversy or as a problem anywhere but Pennsylvania? --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 17:48, 2 February 2008 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd>The controversy is should eBay sellers need an auctioneer's license?

<dd>The only problem with the whole auctioneer's license is that the auctioneer would need one.  EBay would be considered the auctioneer.  Users are only presenting items for auction. ~<font size="3" face="Calibri"><a href="/wiki/User:QuasiAbstract" title="User:QuasiAbstract">QuasiAbstract</a></font> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:QuasiAbstract" title="User talk:QuasiAbstract">talk</a>/<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/QuasiAbstract" title="Special:Contributions/QuasiAbstract">contrib</a>) 00:00, 3 February 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>That's the controversy. EBay was the auctioneer, and she was only presenting items for auction, yet she is still facing a fine of over $11,000,000 for not having an auctioneer's license. --<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/75.181.81.73" title="Special:Contributions/75.181.81.73">75.181.81.73</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:75.181.81.73&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:75.181.81.73 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:01, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>So what's the controversy? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the usage of the term. PA has a law which they're selectively enforcing (saying it's "complaint-driven"), and the PA legislature is making moves to modify the law so the whole issue goes away. Anyway, find some reliable sources that describe it as a "controversy" and you might have a point; you might want to do a search for "ebay auction licensing" -- maybe someone has written a article we can use as a source about the several states that are doing or want to do the same thing: require secondary eBay sellers (that is, people who sell goods for other people) to be licensed as auctioneers. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 16:35, 3 February 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="International">International</span></h2>
<p>The article states, "eBay has already expanded to over two dozen countries including China and India. The only places where expansion failed were Taiwan and Japan,"  This seems to me to be a strictly point-of-view type of claim. It would also seem to be mistaken, as eBay's expansion into China for example(or failure thereof) is well-chronicled. I think there needs to be a citation supporting "the only places where expansion has failed were ...", or else changing the sentence to "the only places where eBay withdrew completely without buying a minority stake in a competitor were .."
</p><p>Overall, if the article is to list all of the international web pages, there needs to be some kind of illustration about the relative sizes, or else the reader will be left with the false impression that each listed venture is significant relative to the whole.  GMV listed, revenue, even page views per area, any of these would be an improvement. Failing that, may I suggest that the list be pruned or else removed entirely.

<p>The company's current business strategy includes increasing revenue by increasing <a href="/wiki/International" class="mw-disambig" title="International">international</a> trade within the eBay system.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>since the portion relating to expansion is POV and not strictly accurate, and since without citation it really remains to be seen tha increasing international trade is a good description of their business strategy or even one of the higher priorities. <a href="/wiki/User:Wphamilton" title="User:Wphamilton">Wphamilton</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wphamilton" title="User talk:Wphamilton">talk</a>) 22:40, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

As a former employee of eBay who worked in Fraud and Customer Identity theft, I can verify there is a huge amount of fraud going on with eBay.  Several of my recent co-workers have tried selling/buying semi high end electronics and have gotten bombarded with stolen/fraudulent accounts.  EBay tries to stem the tide with half-hearted measures but the fraud is still rampant.  They do little against fraud because they don't want to become liable for it.  It's not so much a matter of getting more insertion fees but spending large amounts of money to police their site.  Do a search for HDTVs or Sony Vaios on eBay and take a close look at the seller's feedback and what they used to sell if anything.

</p><p>My impression is that eBay avoids issues of fraud whenever possible, but when forced to face the issue, they take the stance that "we're just a venue" and it's up to others to prove fraud. "We are a marketplace. We are not a retailer," said Hani Durzy, eBay spokesman.

</p><p>Looking at things in a positive side. eBay continues to develop to better cater to their members. They have new policies and regulations that if we are optimistic we will find it benigicial for everybody. Of course we can't please everybody, that is a given fact, but let us remember that the only thing constant is change.

<p>At least, that's what seems to have happened. According to the IP Addresses <a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.113.168.128" title="User talk:216.113.168.128">Talk page</a>, the ip used is owned by eBay.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Unusual_Sale_Item_section">Unusual Sale Item section</span></h2>
<p>IP editor recently <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EBay&amp;diff=385954140&amp;oldid=385379463">added a paragraph to the Unusual Sale Item</a> section, which I removed.  The IP editor disputes my actions and says that as a cited addition it should remain.  I would be grateful for other's input.  I removed it for the following reasons;
</p>
<ul><li>The item was not sold on eBay, merely listed for a short while before being delisted by eBay for violating its terms of use policies.  This sort of thing happens all the time, making it scarcely unusual or notable.</li>
<li>The item was therefore not actually sold on eBay.</li>
<li>The cite provided is a local newspaper, which does not verify half of what was added.  This, in my opinion, makes it non-notable trivia that is largely unverifiable.</li></ul>
<p>Aside from this one addition, there are a number of related problems with section.  The entire section suffers from a fundamental POV weakness in that there is no clear, objective and neutral definition of what counts as 'Unusual'.  More than a few of the articles mentioned are also short lived publicity stunts or jokes.   There should be a clearer division between eBay as a place selling items with a very unusual or limited market, and eBay as a place to stage a publicity stunt and/or joke.   So if these are truly notable, would they not be better in a different section?  --<font color="purple"><a href="/wiki/User:Escape_Orbit" title="User:Escape Orbit">Escape Orbit</a></font> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Escape_Orbit" title="User talk:Escape Orbit">(Talk)</a></sup> 12:38, 22 September 2010 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I agree, the addition is not notable and is only supported by 2 sources (according to google), both of which are local news websites. I don't think that is enough to warrant coverage by a number of individual sources. You're spot on in the point that the whole section is in need of a rewrite and there needs to be a clear definition of what is unusual. There are a number of items that are being sold on eBay that are unusual, but do not warrant coverage. <a href="/wiki/User:L_Kensington" class="mw-redirect" title="User:L Kensington">L Kensington</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:L_Kensington" title="User talk:L Kensington">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/L_Kensington" title="Special:Contributions/L Kensington">contribs</a>) 21:42, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

<p>There's hardly anything written about the feedback system even though it's a significant part of the eBay paradigm. There's a mention of changes, or how things differ from the "overall feedback" but nothing that describes what the "overall feedback" system is. 
</p><p>The whole notion of the feedback system was an essential distinguishing feature of eBay, since a person selling stroller in Peoria to a buyer in Oshkosh needed to know whether to send out the stroller first, or whether the buyer should send a check first. That was especially true before PayPal. 
</p><p>There's also no mention of the shift from the feedback based model to the prepaid/PayPal based model. Although PayPal is not an absolute requirement, there was a back door change to the overall policies when sellers were asked to specify when they are going to ship with respect to when (meaning how long after) they receive payment. Thus its purpose changed to one of a merchant rating system. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Hagrinas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hagrinas (page does not exist)">Hagrinas</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hagrinas" title="User talk:Hagrinas">talk</a>) 19:11, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

<dd>Looking over the refs, there is potential grounds for calling it a controversy (although those refs appear borderline on meeting <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>).

<p>I've removed the passage simply because the article is not a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SOAPBOX" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> for what someone considers "something bad about Ebay". Its a private (meaning non-government) for-profit website and entitled to police its listing and allow or disallow whatever it chooses. It has a history of shying away from controversial topics, so its not a surprise they removed an item like this. --<a href="/wiki/User:Scalhotrod" title="User:Scalhotrod">Scalhotrod - Just your average banjo playing, drag racing, cowboy...</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scalhotrod" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Scalhotrod">talk</a>) 05:35, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
</p><p>Hello Scalhotrod. This was already accepted by editor Barek so I am confused why you deleted it. I am also confused as this is/was a major controversy, irrespective of whatever ebay allows or doesn't allow. eBay allowed Zimmerman to list his painting, but disallowed another artist listing their painting in response. This is extremely noteworthy and was referenced extensively.  Can we have a third wiki editor review this as an impartial adjudicator?

<p>I've again reverted this addition from the lead, since the contributing editor has declined to do it, or discuss.  My problems with this addition twofold;
</p>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RELTIME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RELTIME">time relative expressions are to be avoided</a>.  Using the expression "currently" means nothing to the reader because they have no idea when it was written. It also may be read as speculation that there may be future change, again at some unspecified point in time.   Essentially the lead loses nothing by removing this word entirely.</li>
<li>It is not clear why an old stylisation is of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BEGIN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BEGIN">such significance that it needs to be mentioned in the lead sentence</a>.  Is it of any real importance?  Does it radically affect the reader's understanding of what ebay is presently?  I don't think so.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>Again, I invite the IP editor concerned to discuss this rather than insisting on reverting without any attempt to reach a consensus. --<font color="green"><a href="/wiki/User:Escape_Orbit" title="User:Escape Orbit">Escape Orbit</a></font> <sup>--<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Escape_Orbit" title="User talk:Escape Orbit">(Talk)</a></sup> 20:05, 27 December 2015 (UTC)</li>
<li>These both seem like great points. The logo change doesn't seem so significant as to need to be in the lead. As far as I know this styling is not a major part of the brand. Is there a good reason to include it? <a href="/wiki/User:Prodego" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Prodego" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 05:42, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree it seems inappropriate for the lead. Since none of the revert-happy IPs have offered up any discussion here may I suggest semi-protecting the page as well? <a href="/wiki/User:Qzd" title="User:Qzd">Qzd</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Qzd" title="User talk:Qzd">talk</a>) 05:48, 28 December 2015 (UTC)

<li>I completely agree with Escape Orbit. The old stylisation of the logo is unimportant, and I fail to see the importance in adding it to the lead sentence.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2602:304:CDC0:D470:350D:DF14:1321:6BCB" title="Special:Contributions/2602:304:CDC0:D470:350D:DF14:1321:6BCB">2602:304:CDC0:D470:350D:DF14:1321:6BCB</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2602:304:CDC0:D470:350D:DF14:1321:6BCB" title="User talk:2602:304:CDC0:D470:350D:DF14:1321:6BCB">talk</a>) 05:57, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>

I've seen other articles that refer to the stylization in the lead, but I can't remember which ones. Why should it be so... "Hahhh, <b>terrible</b>, HAHH!" just to have that here too?

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Kesha's name was written differently in text, but "ebaY" only refers to a logo stylization. That seems beyond the scope of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE">WP:LEADSENTENCE</a>. AFAIK the company has always been "eBay" or "eBay Inc" in writing. <a href="/wiki/User:Qzd" title="User:Qzd">Qzd</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Qzd" title="User talk:Qzd">talk</a>) 07:43, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>What's the difference? Ebay's name was always "eBay," which is written differently in text than its logo shows too! Kesha's "logo" was "Ke$ha." What's so "terrible" about having the distinctions for ebay? Is your lead really <b>that</b> "sacred"? What about the band "<a href="/wiki/Fun." class="mw-redirect" title="Fun.">fun.</a>"? Why don't we go and remove all the stylization notes from the leads of all of those that have them, especially if they're just former?
</p><p>And what about <a href="/wiki/X_Clan" title="X Clan">X Clan</a>? And why don't <b>THESE</b> two articles need absolute time references either? Should I go look for some more? There are several more examples I can certainly use if these "aren't good enough" for you for some ridiculous reason!
</p>
<dl><dd>Again, those are stylizations to the name <i>in writing</i>, not only the logo design. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:REALTIME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:REALTIME">WP:REALTIME</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE">WP:LEADSENTENCE</a> are established guidelines, so it's not very productive to argue against them by cherry-picking other articles. The question is: is it appropriate for this article? <a href="/wiki/User:Qzd" title="User:Qzd">Qzd</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Qzd" title="User talk:Qzd">talk</a>) 09:03, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>How do you even know that for sure? Where's your source? And even if so, then what? Minor difference. "Big deal." What's so "hellaciously <b>wrong</b>" with showing the differentiations between them here at the lead of this article too, if it doesn't really add more length than those other mentions do? Why must it be so damned "sacred" to you? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/174.23.172.2" title="Special:Contributions/174.23.172.2">174.23.172.2</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:174.23.172.2" title="User talk:174.23.172.2">talk</a>) 20:20, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Because it's unimportant clutter.  The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEADSENTENCE">lead sentence</a> is all about hitting the reader with the key facts about the article subject.  An obsolete stylisation of their logo is not one of them.  I've inviting you a number of times to explain why it is so significant, but you seem determined to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#BATTLEGROUND" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">pick arguments</a> instead. Reverting repeatedly, accusing others of sockpuppeting and vandalism, <b>SHOUTING</b> and demanding "why not!" is not how you establish consensus.  As for other articles; just because they may (or may not) fail to follow the manual of style is no reason for this article to do likewise.  So please, calm down, and give us a reason why it should.  A number of people have already explained "why not", now <i>you</i> tell us why. --<font color="green"><a href="/wiki/User:Escape_Orbit" title="User:Escape Orbit">Escape Orbit</a></font> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Escape_Orbit" title="User talk:Escape Orbit">(Talk)</a></sup> 21:00, 28 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree. eBay has always been known as eBay, Ebay, or EBay, regardless of the exact logo style. Unlike Ke$ha, the differences between them are simply capitalization, so there is no chance of confusion. eBay has not prominently featured a specifically capitalization, it is not essential to their brand. Therefore, I don't think it belongs in the lead, though I do think we should have an image of the old logo somewhere in the article (though perhaps not call out the specifically capitalization explicitly).</dd>
<dd>Also, since I have become involved here, I will not unprotect the page, I'll leave that to another admin when they believe consensus has developed.  <a href="/wiki/User:Prodego" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Prodego" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 06:07, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Agreed.  There is no problem with this being discussed within the article.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Uh, I actually *DID* give an explanation, but you chose to ignore it. And I said that *you* were being a vandal just like you said that I was being one. Just because you don't like my reasoning doesn't mean I was being a vandal. Yes, it is actually specific to their brand. Would they change their logo for nothing? Why is it any "worse" for ebay's stylization, former or not, to be mentioned in the lead than for any other article where stylization is mentioned in the lead for any other reason? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/75.162.217.153" title="Special:Contributions/75.162.217.153">75.162.217.153</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:75.162.217.153" title="User talk:75.162.217.153">talk</a>) 01:07, 30 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>At this point I think the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CONSENSUS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CONSENSUS">consensus</a> is clearly against adding this material to the lead.

<p>If, by "refuses to work collaboratively," this combative user really means "refuses to be shut completely out" because he insists on reverting <b>past</b> the middle ground of having only the <i>current</i> stylization mentioned in the lead, which <i>is</i> actually what <b>he and at least two others of you <i>had already been reverting to</i></b>, instead of just reverting to that again, then yeah, I refuse, of course!
</p><p>But if, on the other hand, this combative user actually means what he says, then that's a bold-faced <b>lie</b>! I <i>am</i> here talking this out, am I not? I <i>am</i> proposing compromises that don't completely go in one direction or the other, am I not? This <b>is</b> collaboration! So if, amongst all the earlier reversions, you guys were happy to only revert to the way that it was before with the current stylization still mentioned in the lead but not the former one, then why are you so adamant to dig deeper now and eliminate both?

</p><p>"Refuses to work collaboratively" is actually what <b>you guys</b> are doing, because to you it must be <b>all about what YOU guys want</b> and nothing of what I want, and instead I should just be treated as second-class merely because I'm IP-only. LOL, "<b>start</b> a discussion on the talk page"? So what do you call ^^^ <b>THIS</b> ^^^ then?
</p><p>Um, I'm talking about reversions that came <b>before</b> that, prodigo. The reversions that came <b>before</b> that are what escape orbit and his little buddy-buddies were already <b>happy</b> with going back to (where "[stylized as 'ebay']" remained) after I added mention of the former style to that part of the lead. So if they were happy with that, then why are you and your buddy-pals stooping to this <i>new</i> low of taking those <b>both</b> out? Is it just a ploy to get me to be happy with just having the article read the same old way as it did with the current style mentioned in the lead but not the new one (in other words, creating some new, worse but fake "bad news" so that the previous lesser, but real, bad news will just seem more acceptable to the receiver)?
</p><p>And why even ask whether or not this "current" from the infobox should stay or not, since your little preffy-friend escape orbit already took that out as part of being consistent with his little complaint that I had added "currently" to the first mention of style? If you'd like to take him more seriously because he has a user name and he's... well... him, then why did that ever get removed in the first place, and then why was it reverted when you guys knew that <b>I</b> was taking it back out after that?
</p><p>I get why the wiki community might favor editions from a "high-and-mighty admin," but why does it seem like most of it also bows down to non-admin named editors over IPers too, huh?
</p><p>And why is it that you consider <b>my</b> reversions as "edit-warring" but you guys' are somehow "not" even though you're just putting the stuff back too? Have you forgotten that one of the rules regarding edit-warring includes "even if you believe you are right"? Well <b>you</b> guys think <b>you</b> are "right" and you keep reverting too. How are <b>you</b> guys supposedly "not" edit-warring too, huh?
</p>
<dl><dd>You still haven't supplied any reason why it is so important that this be in the lead.  And yet you continue to cast allegations.  For someone who gets so offended at being addressed as a new users, you don't appear to understand much about how Wikipedia is compiled.  If you can't accept consensus and take alteration of your edits as personal insults, then perhaps Wikipedia isn't for you? --<font color="green"><a href="/wiki/User:Escape_Orbit" title="User:Escape Orbit">Escape Orbit</a></font> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Escape_Orbit" title="User talk:Escape Orbit">(Talk)</a></sup> 10:28, 30 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I never said that changing my edits was akin to an insult, escape, but just by your saying that you deserve to feel that way about your own.
</p><p>What you guys are calling "consensus" is actually <b>not,</b> unless you think "let us 3 or 4 guys leave one guy out" rightfully amounts to "consensus." But if you do, then <i>you</i> are actually the fool. I did not consent.
</p><p>I already <b>did</b> answer your question, but you've chosen to be too ignorant to pay attention to it. Yet you have still not yet managed to answer mine about why, even though you were satisfied before with reverting to "(stylized as 'ebay')" without the former, you aren't even satisfied with <i>that</i> now and want to even use your half-smile buddy to remove even <i>that</i> now. 
</p><p>And why is it that you guys think you have to act like "just because you think something is <i>unimportant</i> then it <i>actively <b>must NOT</b> be used</i>? Since when did passive content require active prohibition?
</p><p>And you haven't even answered why, <i>even though <b>you</b> were the one who took off "current" from the infobox when you took "currently" from the style mention,</i> one of you went and put "current" <b>back ON</b> the infobox for no good reason, or why when <b>I</b> took it back off, you had one of your little cohort buddies <i>stick that <b>back</b> on</i> even after <b>you</b> already wanted it off!

<dl><dd>Because "us guys" are not, despite your repeated accusations, working as some kind of team, just to annoy you.  We are individual editors working to improve Wikipedia and create and follow consensus. We may not agree precisely on everything, but we work together.  Again, if you don't get this then editing Wikipedia is not for you.</dd>
<dd>The justification you've given for your addition hasn't swayed anyone. Sorry. The fact you've focussed on "it should go in because I want it in, and everyone else is colluding to stop it" hasn't helped.  The combative tone you've taken from the start <i>really</i> hasn't helped you. Many of your comments are in breach of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">'assume good faith'</a> guideline and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CIVIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CIVIL">civility</a> policy.  You need to calm down.</dd>
<dd>In reply to your question; if something is unimportant it shouldn't be in the lead because it gets in the way of the things that <i>are</i> important.  The reader does not want to have to wade through trivia to obtain the key facts.  This is particularly important in the lead because many presentations of the article (such as in web search results or mobile applications) initially only show the first sentence of the article.  We shouldn't waste that abbreviated display with detail that is, frankly, of very little interest to most people.  Yes, what counts as of interest can be a matter of opinion and taste, but in this case most in this discussion agree that this is not.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately you are now way over the line in regards to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3RR">your edit warring</a>.  You have already been warned in regards to this, so please do not revert this article again.  Please take this as friendly advice.  --<font color="green"><a href="/wiki/User:Escape_Orbit" title="User:Escape Orbit">Escape Orbit</a></font> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Escape_Orbit" title="User talk:Escape Orbit">(Talk)</a></sup> 19:41, 30 December 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>escape orbit (yeah, I did that on purpose), It looks like I <i>am</i> going to have to be uncivil to you because you are not getting my point otherwise. Simply put, you are a moron. Yes, you were being uncivil to me by <b>ass</b>uming that I said "because I want it in." I never said that. That's how morons think, and hence this description for you. There's a <b>BIG</b> difference between that stupid thing you just falsely put on my keyboard and this quote: "It explains that there's the difference between <i>text-only</i> 'eBay' and the actual <b>logo</b> that's more like 'ebay', but also the distinction between that same lame text-only 'eBay' and how it used to be styled, which was ' 'ebaY' <b> until late 2012."</b></dd>
<dd>Your tone has been at least as combative as you think mine has, so <b>you</b> are the one who needs to calm down. Wikipedia editing actually <i>isn't for <b>you</b></i>.</dd>
<dd>You obviously don't know quite how 3RR works. If someone reverts <b>more</b> than 3 times <i>in the same day's worth of time,</i> then they have broken 3RR. Not until then.</dd>
<dd>You guys may not be on the same exact team, but you claim "consensus" despite that I'm not part of that as one of the editors in the dispute. You <i>still</i> have not answered my question of why you guys in that supposed "consensus" have gone <b>deeper</b> than you were already satisfied with before. Perhaps I should ask the one who is doing it most recently, fakesmile. In fact, even <i>he</i> or <i>she</i> is edit-warring now. Just because s/he's part of your consensus doesn't mean s/he's not edit-warring. So there's that issue too.</dd>
<dd><b>You</b>, escape orbit, have falsely assumed bad faith onto me. Remember the times you falsely called me a "vandal"? What do you call that assumption, huh?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>And even though semi-smile girl has finally now REremoved "current" from the infobox like you did before, orbit, you still have never answered me on why it got back there in the first place. What about that?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Define "lead" in this context. How far does it go? Is it just the first paragraph?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay, <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Slightsmile" title="User:Slightsmile">Slightsmile</a>:</span> when you first started your reversion junk here, even <b>you</b> would only revert to the point of where escape orbit left the "(stylized as 'ebay')" in place without the old version. Go back up and look at his bullets here and then look at your reversions. All of you who were doing those early reversions in your little group that you called "consensus" were originally only reverting to the point of leaving the mention of the <b>current</b> style in the lead, according to the earlier discussion here. Originally you guys were only saying that mentioning the <b>former</b> style in the lead was "too much" for you, so you didn't erase them both. <i>Why are you guys erasing them <b>both</b> now, even though the original concern was only against the <b>old</b> one?</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>For example, the paragraph about our 2014 security breach appears to confuse two separate events. In February 2014, the Syrian Electronic Army replaced the homepages for a very limited number of people visiting certain eBay and PayPal pages in the UK, France and India. The issue was quickly detected and resolved, and no customer accounts were affected. Source: <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The Syrian Electronic Army attack is separate from the security breach that required a password reset. As currently depicted in the Wikipedia entry, the two events appear to have been merged. 
</p><p>As noted in the existing sources for this paragraph, the security breach in May 2014 was a result of hackers compromising a small number of employee log-in credentials. The hackers did not gain access to financial information and users were forced to reset their passwords as a precautionary measure. Source: <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Based on this, how does this community feel about something like the following?:
“In early February 2014, the Syrian Electronic Army replaced the eBay and PayPal homepages for a limited number of people in the UK, France and India. The issue was quickly detected and resolved, and no customer accounts were affected. In a separate event, on May 21, 2014, the company revealed that the consumer database of usernames, passwords, phone numbers, and physical addresses had been breached by hackers who compromised a small number of employee log-in credentials. eBay users were advised to change their passwords; in order to expedite this a "change password" feature was added to profiles of users who had not yet done so. The eBay stock value fell in response to the disclosure.” 
</p><p>Thanks for your consideration. I look forward to joining the conversation.
