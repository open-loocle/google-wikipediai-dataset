<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spam_notice">Spam notice</span></h2>
<p>Do we really need the spam notice in the links section?  We get maybe 2-3 undiscussed links added per week, not all are spam.  And the links are generally removed within 24 hours.  (Saying that because of my self-imposed 1RR limit on link cleanup.  And that's 1RR per calander day, not 24 hour period, so I'll sometimes have 2 reverts within a 24 hour period.  But if I've already cleaned up that day, I'll wait for the next day to clean up again.  But I digress....)  The Spam warning appears to be to solicit additional help to patrol the section.  But I don't really see the need.  Anyone see a good reason I shouldn't just drop the tag?

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I know what you mean.  Awhile back I tried to rename "Examples" to "Exemplary", the idea being this:  The list of web tools shouldn't be a directory, it should be a showcase of specific applications that serve to further the reader's understanding of the subject (Google Maps).  I think that's a reasonable inclusion &amp;ndash but it must be tightly monintored so it doesn't get out of hand. -<a href="/wiki/User:Joshuapaquin" title="User:Joshuapaquin">Joshuapaquin</a> 21:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>We've gone over this ground several times on the talk page.  If you look back over it, including the one archived history, you'll see where we came from.  To summarize, at one point in time the links section at the bottom was huge.  It was rightly deleted in whole.  In response to the full deletion, we came together on the talk page, and decided on an agreed upon set of example links in several categories.  It was felt that the nature of Google Maps made it important to include at least a small sampling of the best sites in each of several categories.  Now, we have informal rules in place, mostly enforced by me (by once a day clean-up edits), that any additional links need to be discussed here on the talk page.  We have specifically discussed the arial view section a couple of times, and the conscensous has been that each of the four remaining has something to offer. (Please read earlier discussions for the reasonings here.)</dd>
<dd>So we has a small sampling, and while we have a regular trickle of additional links being added, we have a working process in place that is dealing with the situation.  I really don't see the need of bringing in a bunch of additional people to deal with a situation that, IMHO, is fully under control at this point in time. - <a href="/wiki/User:TexasAndroid" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 21:55, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

Please, teach me, tell me, or show me how to present this info to others. You can run the trace from their server or from your PC. It has some settings you can tweak for doing the traceroute.   It also can also do “whois” queries when you click on one of the hops (to find out that hop's IP).   And if you just want to know where any particular computer/server/IP is you can also type in the IP or host name in their ping tool and find out if the host is up, where it is, and get the “whois” record. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:M_kat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:M kat (page does not exist)">M kat</a> 23:31, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>It would be nice to have a more precise statement of what's blurred and who's responsible.  John Young at Cryptome documented various mapping services' pixellation of some U.S. regions, which was apparently done upstream by imagery providers.  (I also recall that Google Maps showed unpixellated images of more portions of Washington, D.C., during a period when the government of India was complaining about the satellite photography, but that those regions became pixellated again later.  However, I don't have exact dates when these changes took place.)  One possibility would be add a link to John Young's discussion, because I recall it as quite thorough, even if not up-to-date. <a href="/wiki/User:Schoen" title="User:Schoen">Schoen</a> 19:46, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>

Hello, I hope I am not imposing, but have a request to consider Hotel Maps USA. After two years of unemployment (35 years systems analyst background-job outsourced overseas) and over a year of tremendous night and day effort to teach myself newer technologies, I have created 17,000 maps of hotels and attractions for cities across the USA and Canada. They are quite relevant as reference material to travel, tourism, and an example implementation of the Google Maps API. There are places such as St Paul MN for the 2008 Republican National Convention, and many maps of speedways, and drag strips. Hotel Maps USA also includes an address finder. You are linking to some huge companies that are very hard for one impoverished person to compete with, so any break you can give me is very appreciated.

The few links on the page are here because they are key examples of Google Maps API and other technology.  Everything on this page is here because of Google Maps, not the specific focus use of some of the links.  So, if you want us to accept your link, you need to tell us why, from a Google Maps perspective, the link deserves to be on the page.  All the info about what your site does is interesting, but totally irrelevant.  We need to know, not what makes your site useful from a Hotel perspective, but what makes it unique and important as an example of Google Maps use.  Why does your link deserve to be on the page over many, many other API uses?  What makes your link stand out as a example of usage of the Google Maps API?  I'm sorry to be harsh, but the project is not here to help you advertise your page.  This article is here to document Google Maps.  And as such, any arguments you make for inclusion of your link need to be from a GMaps perspective, not a Hotel perspective. - <a href="/wiki/User:TexasAndroid" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 13:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Hotel Maps USA is an example of a one-person Google Maps project, which has refined processes to create, and update, a multitude of interactive maps, without relying on location marker input by external multiple users. In its' first year, 2006, 17,000 maps were created for cities and places of interest throughout the USA and Canada. Each place of interest, when added to the database, generates a new map, centered and zoomed to the specific location. Each new map automatically includes markers for other nearby places of interest, and nearby cities and towns.

<p>Typically, massive volumes of maps, and/or the placement of markers on maps, have been created by either relying on the input of hundreds or thousands of users, or a well-funded department within a corporation. This application of the API is atypical, because it resulted in a high-volume of nice maps by one individual, constrained by a shoestring budget. If other individuals of limited resources have already produced such good results on such a massive scale, I don't know of them. I consider my work to be an example of the application of the Google maps API within a burgeoning cottage industry, which can produce a level of results which were previously achieved only by well-funded corporations.

</p><p>I think most of the API page should be merged into a rewritten "Extensibility and customization" on this Google Maps article. The section here mostly deals with the pre-API hacks which are pretty much irrelevant now.
</p><p>I take the term "Google Maps" to mean the "Google Maps API". Although there was originally a separate (beta-only) Maps page, the mapping service that Google provides is now called Google Local. Google Local just embeds the Google Maps interface and adds features on top (such as driving directions).
</p><p>To clarify the distinction further a separate Google Local page could be created where we can move various Local-specific information, such as the competitor links.

<p>In my opinion the site is unique as it is the only site which allows you to do geographic searches for travel itineraries, users or stories. The search for stories for example can be done on a street or block level or on a whole continent. The website is interactive (the user input and search for content). It also shows that using javascript you are able to write routines like painting rectangles on the maps and use them for obtaining coordinates for searches in databases, also a registered user can send messages to other users directly from within a google-maps-infowindow. If you have any further questions I would be happy to talk about them.

</p><p>I'm sorry, but I really don't see those as unique applications of the GMaps interface.  You may or may not be the only place doing "searches for travel itineraries, users or stories", but there are other sites that do searches.

<p>I was using the aerial photo feature of Google maps to look at an area that interests me and noticed that different buildings were taken from distinctly different viewpoints. Buildings that are near each other have very different perspectives, slanting up at you in ways that don't make visual sense. These are good shots so I'm not complaining, but the over-all image is a peculiar mix of perspectives. The different shots are knitted together perfectly so I can't see where they're joined. So I'm just wondering a few things: why would pictures from different satellite shots be combined at such a fine-grained scale, how were they compiled into a larger image, etc. If I could, I would include an example from the area that struck me but I don't see a way to add an image. Just enter "Millennium Hotel Minneapolis" in Google maps. Zoom in pretty close. Move the map so that the area you see is a bit north and west of the hotel. You'll start to see some of these anomalies. If anyone can tell me how to show an image, I can add it.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Cc_brewster&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cc brewster (page does not exist)">Cc brewster</a> 04:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>Since only one point is directly below the camera, there is always some degree of "tilt". The amount of tilt increases toward the edge of each photo. The choice of how much tilt is acceptable is part of what determines the size of each "tile" to be mosaicked together. Much of the high-res imagery in google maps is made with airplanes rather than satellites, especially in the United States. Since airplanes fly much closer to the ground, the tile size of acceptable tilt is going to be relatively small. That's the basic answer. As to how the mosaicking is done -- a short answer is, painfully and slowly! <a href="/wiki/User:Pfly" title="User:Pfly">Pfly</a> 20:40, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>Ok why is the example map at the top a map of Southern Ontario??
</p><p>Rhetorical question -- I'll tell you why: <i>because Wiki has been hijacked by a cabal of young Southern Ontario</i> (I don't know what else to call them...) <i>nerds</i>.  Whose sole purpose seems to be to artificially boost Southern Ontario, tricking Americans and other foreigners into investing there and continuing the insane population growth in Southern Ontario that doesn't make sense.
</p><p>I'm sorry if I sound 'wonky' on this but I see it over and over.  Like the Wiki article about the "GTA" and many others (as well as similar diatribes on Emporis), there seems to be this group of nerds living in their parents' basements in bungalows scattered throughout Etobicoke and Scarborough who have nothing better to do with their miserable lives except spend hours on Wiki, and similar sites, making Southern Ontario look good.
</p><p>Never mind that Southern Ontario and Southern Quebec have been 100% artificially created by government dictatorship for over 200 years.  What with the Staple Theory of economic development, a non-regional non-US type Senate, exploitation of natural resources, import tariffs, the Auto Pact, centralized bank laws, differential freight rates and preferential government procurement rules.  The list goes on.
</p><p>It's all a parasite/host relationship, where Southern Ontario-Southern Quebec are the parasites, and the natural resource rich hinterland of Canada -- representing 98% of its land mass, by the way! -- are the hosts.  Think it's like that in America?  Uh-uh.  Check it out; do the math.  You'll see.

Trrolling or not, here's some historical info from an old GIS guy: The Southern Ontario data exactly agrees with the sample data that MapInfo made freely available for many years. For the longest time Map data was fabulously expensive, freely usable data rare, and anyone wanting to show how to do ANYTHING with map data was as likely to use this data as any other. Of course, you could argue that this just shifts the finger of blame to MapInfo...  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.68.32.159" title="Special:Contributions/24.68.32.159">24.68.32.159</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.68.32.159&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:24.68.32.159 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:24, 14 December 2009 (UTC)</span>

<p>Let's not confuse <i>international</i> and <i>extranational</i>/<i>foreign</i> (though many people do). <i>International</i> means "<i>between</i> countries". If the word was used properly, it presumably means that, say, Yahoo! Maps won't give complete driving directions if the destination isn't in the same country as the origin. On the other hand, if <i>foreign</i> was meant, then, yeah, it's too vague. — <a href="/wiki/User:Preslethe" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Preslethe" title="User talk:Preslethe">talk</a>) 03:56, 19 July 2010 (UTC)

<p>Someone who knows how to do it, should add Mexico on the map on contiguous regions on Google Maps. I have tried myself, you can now search for directions in Mexico (and some other small places that are not very important like Turks and Caicos Islands). There are also some countries that in fact are only partially covered by the direction service in Google Maps, which is not reflected in the map. I suppose it is very difficult to change the map in this respect, but if not, then e.g. Svalbard (part of Norway) should not be yellow and parts of Peru (north and (north-)east) should not be blue. <a href="/wiki/User:Qu%C3%A9S%C3%A9Yo2" title="User:QuéSéYo2">QuéSéYo2</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qu%C3%A9S%C3%A9Yo2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:QuéSéYo2 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:21, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="EXPENDITURE_BASED_TOPOGRAPHIC_IMAGES_OF_CITIES">EXPENDITURE BASED TOPOGRAPHIC IMAGES OF CITIES</span></h2>
<p>NEW MAPS&#160;: Is NYC a barren wasteland for the poor, punctuated with rare Oases of 
free public space&#160;?
</p><p>If you have money to spend, NYC is a wonderful city. 24/7 you need only go
a few feet to find businesses, people and places ready to cater to your every want, 
need or whim. Restaurants tempt with an enormous variety of food,
shops with sales, online/phone services with more sales and delivery, health clubs, 
doctors, spas and private trainers will help you to get in shape, look better or feel great.
If you are cold, hail a cab or a car service and you will be wisked in comfort to your destination.
</p><p>But NYC has a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT *TOPOGRAPHY* if you DO NOT HAVE MONEY
TO SPEND.  
</p><p>GOOGLE MAPS SHOULD CREATE A MAP OF *INDOOR* PUBLICLY
ACCESSABLE SPACES WHERE A PERSON WOULD
not just be able to sneak in and blend, but rather would be 
WELCOME to stay - WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MONEY.
</p><p>In the Upper East Side in NYC - for example - there are very few.
Public libraries are scarce, overcrowded and have VERY limited hours.  
There are a few indoor public spaces like the Citicorp building 
atrium which is similarly crowded.
</p><p>ALMOST ALL OTHER PLACES REQUIRE MONEY. Otherwise, the city is CLOSED TO YOU -
JUST AS IF IT WERE A BARREN HOSTILE WASTELAND.  Buses and subways require
$2.25.  Where can you find even an indoor public bathroom nowadays or
a drink of water or a place to sit and warm up&#160;?  (Let alone a place to
exercise or read or access the web to look for a job without significant
expenditure).
</p><p>I envision a TOPOGRAPHIC MAP.  Instead
of color coded altitude above sea level, I envision it with color codes
for COST OF BEING WELCOME in a publicly accessible indoor space.
</p><p>Levels&#160;:
</p><p>$0   - very few - public libraries during open hours, a few public atria.
</p><p>$1  NOT enough even for McDonalds -
the cheapest item from the $1 menu is $1.09 (tax).  This will allow
to you stay as a welcome CUSTOMER, not a surreptitious intruder for
a while and warm up.
</p><p>COffee shops - not anymore - minimal cost is about $3.
</p><p>Pizza - not any more - with the rare exception of the 99cent stand up pizza
places - most Pizza costs $2.50 - $3  per slice (a minimal cost to be WELCOMED 
to sit in the space).
</p><p>Many food shops - including the major supermarket oligopolies (eg. Food Emporium) 
and the similar "pharmacies" (Duane Reed/Walgreens , etc) and bodegas have 
ELIMINATED ALL ITEMS below $1.
</p><p>So the TOPOGRAPHIC MAP of NYC for
$0 or $1 is almost an empty unaccessible dessert.  
</p><p>By contrast at $100 the average distance you need to travel to a 
welcoming space is probably less than half a block.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.88.88.59" title="Special:Contributions/65.88.88.59">65.88.88.59</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:65.88.88.59" title="User talk:65.88.88.59">talk</a>) 20:14, 28 December 2012 (UTC)</span>

Bad article name aside, I don't think the "Google Maps (application)" article is necessary, since it is just describing the mobile version of a much larger, more feature-rich service (so there isn't a lot that distinguishes the two). I can't recall any other instance in which a mobile app had a separate article from the main article about the same service. For example, <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="/wiki/ITunes" title="ITunes">iTunes</a>, two other widely used mobile apps, don't have separate articles for their main service and mobile version. A simple "mobile" subsection in the Google Maps article should be sufficient to describe the mobile app. i agree.<a href="/wiki/User:Y2kcrazyjoker4" title="User:Y2kcrazyjoker4">Y2Kcrazyjoker4</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Y2kcrazyjoker4" title="User talk:Y2kcrazyjoker4">talk</a> &#8226;  <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Y2kcrazyjoker4" title="Special:Contributions/Y2kcrazyjoker4">contributions</a>) 14:00, 27 June 2014 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b> per Frmorrison.<br />This is about a front-end application (such as <a href="/wiki/Google_Earth" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a> is another) which in principle is something distinct from the overall service. It can be included in the main article, but if that one is is too long, it can also be broken out. There's nothing wrong with it. Rather could <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">facebook</a> (which the proponent points to) being split into two separate articles covering the company and the service respectively, and if its mobile frontend is deemed particularly noteworthy, it could be broken out, too.<br />So the article should be retained yet renamed to <a href="/wiki/Google_Maps_(mobile_application)" class="mw-redirect" title="Google Maps (mobile application)">Google Maps (mobile application)</a>. --<a href="/wiki/User:PanchoS" title="User:PanchoS">PanchoS</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:PanchoS" title="User talk:PanchoS">talk</a>) 06:49, 15 December 2014 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm inclined to <b>oppose</b> - typically, yes, it would be best to just have a section covering the app on the main article. In this particular instance, however, I think the application is independent enough on features and has received enough independent secondary coverage (reviews, controversy, etc.) to warrant its own article. <b>~<i><a href="/wiki/User:SuperHamster" title="User:SuperHamster"><span style="color:#07517C">Super</span></a></i><a href="/wiki/User:SuperHamster" title="User:SuperHamster"><span style="color:#6FA23B">Hamster</span></a></b> <small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:SuperHamster" title="User talk:SuperHamster">Talk</a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/SuperHamster" title="Special:Contributions/SuperHamster">Contribs</a></small> 23:54, 8 January 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>

If you believe the specific link should be exempt from the blacklist, you may <a href="/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Spam-whitelist" title="MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist">request that it is white-listed</a>.

<p>Is there any info on how Google monetizes Maps, what kind of revenue it has?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bold_Cleanup">Bold Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I addressed the excessively long and too many sections.
</p><p>All of the features and technical specs were fascinating to read about, but their notability needs to be more than a Google owned blog post. I have left the ones that are well cited/fixable and did some tweaking myself. I tried to organize my changes in smaller edits, so that anyone can examine them and undo if any were erroneous. 
</p><p>The <i>History</i> of Google Maps is just bad wrong usage. If a feature was modified in 3 different time periods, I would have to look at 3 different subsections to find it, and also cross reference with the feature list itself. I removed what was poorly cited, and left what I think can fit into existing or new sections. For example Google policy around naming could be a section. For my inspiration, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/@mbogen/is-google-wired-for-geopolitics-77ae9a2d7fa2">https://medium.com/@mbogen/is-google-wired-for-geopolitics-77ae9a2d7fa2</a> <a href="/wiki/User:Shushugah" title="User:Shushugah">Shushugah</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Shushugah" title="User talk:Shushugah">talk</a>) 15:04, 12 July 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Just because your belief in Google Maps's inaccuracy is supported by evidence doesn't mean it can be introduced in a nonconstructive way. If you were, perhaps, to dig up a few essays from trustworthy sources discussing its inaccuracy, create a new section on the article, and provide a well-written summary of the entire affair, your edits would surely stick. However, introducing random sentences, at random locations in the article, about its inaccuracy adds nothing at all to the article, and serves only to destroy well-written paragraphs while replacing them with nothing. If you don't feel up to this, flag the article as incomplete and wait for someone else to come clean it up, but don't just violate every rule of the community out of a need to prove a point. <a href="/w/index.php?title=81.129.82.170&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="81.129.82.170 (page does not exist)">81.129.82.170</a> 12:52, 14 August 2018 (UTC) <small>This was originally added a reply to the user's talk page but this reply is added here to prevent discontinuity. – <a href="/wiki/User:TheGridExe" class="mw-redirect" title="User:TheGridExe"><span style="color:navy">TheGridExe</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheGridExe" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:TheGridExe"><span style="color:navy">talk</span></a>) </small></dd></dl>
