I came here looking for objections and criticisms, and I only find them on the talk page, with comments that they don't belong in the article itself.

<p>Why is this merited? Is it on every social networking site? Every online community? Also, this is completely one-sided. If it's going to be in there at all, it needs to be balanced.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LinkedIn_Deceptive">LinkedIn Deceptive</span></h2>
<p>LinkedIn is deceptive. Visitors are urged to join LinkedIn and provide personal information. Only after spending time to set up their "accounts" do they find out that they cannot actually contact any other LinkedIn members without paying for premium membership.  This is a sleazy practice when done without prior notification and should be revealed in the Main Article. <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.100.59.68" title="Special:Contributions/70.100.59.68">70.100.59.68</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.100.59.68&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:70.100.59.68 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dl><dd>That's not at all accurate. You do have to "connect" with people -- preferably people you know and trust -- in order to contact other LinkedIn members. But there is no limit on how many connections you can have. The typical person can easily find several hundred people they know who are already members (and they give you a tool to automate this). Once you've started identifying the relationships you already have, it's very easy to send introduction requests -- no, not directly, but through your trusted contacts. With just 100 connections, you should have visibility into 2 to 3 million people. The fact that you have to establish your existing relationships within the system in order to contact other people is kind of the whole point -- certainly not a deception. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.27.11.88&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.27.11.88 (page does not exist)">24.27.11.88</a> 18:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>It is not a "personal beef", it is something that affects all of LinkedIn's users (millions of accounts).  The ability to pool from more than one list of contacts is at the <b>very heart</b> of the product/service in question.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>This is not a good place for criticism of one of a site's non-core features, based on personal observation.  It may be a very good and astute personal observation.  But if there's a bug or a feature problem that makes the site less useful than it could be, they'll deal with it in good time.  Or they won't.  If it's not newsworthy to other people it shouldn't be in the article, though.  As an encyclopedia we rely on the fact-checking, neutrality, balance, and context of reliable published sources to tell us what is worth reporting and what is not.  Moreover, as I've said I don't think it's pertinent to an understanding of what LinkedIn is or its context in the world of social/business networking sites.  That's our job here, to be a compendium of human knowledge - not a product review/guide.  I'm not just nitpicking here.  We couldn't be a good product guide even if we wanted.  C/Net has a leg up there because you can count on their having actually looked at and tested software in a dispassionate way.  Here, notices of software feature problems would always be spotty and unpredictable.  Without context, it's impossible to get a sense of whether this illustrates a design/engineering weakness of the company, an isolated goof, a reasonable balance of competing goals, an uncompleted code-base, or something intrinsic to account maintenance that affects all sites.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">Wikidemo</a> 16:05, 2 October 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I do not understand why it is "overkill", but I can imagine that you find it overkill. The fact that it is "impossible to read" is questionable. As a matter of fact all the terms are in english and it shows what are the main concepts of LinkedIn. I admit that the readability is a real question, but I would say that someone with no knowledge could read the words, while someone with more knowledge could read more. A very important point is that this diagram is NOT a "database design". This is a conceptual diagram and it does not show in any sense how the database is implemented (that would be not relevant). Lately I'm not sure to understand why it is not related to LinkedIn since it only speaks about LinkedIn. In fact I'm open to all suggestions and would like to better understand why the description of the concepts managed by a systems are irrelevant with the respect to the description of the system. Is it just a matter of form&#160;? If the same piece of information was represented as text, it would be ok, no? (in fact I plan to put more models on wikipedia, so I'm really interested in having this discussion) Thanks in advance. <a href="/wiki/User:Jean-Marie_Favre" title="User:Jean-Marie Favre">User:Jean-Marie_Favre</a>  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/129.88.254.195" title="Special:Contributions/129.88.254.195">129.88.254.195</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:129.88.254.195&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:129.88.254.195 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:45, 13 February 2008 (UTC)</small>
<dl><dd>There are a number of problems.  One primary issue is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR"> original research</a>.  It contains observations, and analysis, of the LinkedIn site, made from and verifiable only by direct examination of the site itself.  I won't try to justify this because it's a basic universal principle of Wikipedia, but we only offer material that has already been published in reliable sources, not new analysis of article subjects made specifically for Wikipedia.  Whereas most images do not have the same verifiability concerns, a chart made from data or analysis raises the question of what the data is and where it comes from.  Second, although it's not rocket science to create or read one of these, it is a technical document that probably goes beyond most people's heads.  As someone with some computer background I don't find it very useful to understand LinkedIn.  If I want to know how it works I can just go to the site and see for myself (although if I were doing some analysis or design based on LinkedIn, the diagram would be a good starting point and save me some work).  Third, it's nonstandard.  It's useful to have some consistency among articles about similar subjects so people know what to expect out of Wikipedia.  There may be some other UML diagrams but I haven't noticed them - most articles don't have this.  Fourth, it is unreadable in the condensed version in the article.  You have to click on it to expand.  That's a stylistic issue.  Anyway, I don't think all of this is very important.  It's harmless and someone obviously spent a lot of time working on it.  The article is far from perfect in so many other ways, so I haven't felt any urge to delete it myself.  If the article were an especially good, complete one I would be a little more concerned with perfecting it.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">Wikidemo</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:32, 13 February 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Ok, fine. Thanks for this long answer. I appreciated it very much. I totally agree with the sentence "It contains observations, and analysis, of the LinkedIn site, made from and verifiable only by direct examination of the site itself.", which is absolutely true, but I didn't thought this was a problem, on the contrary. I will revise the WO:OR to better understand. WRT the second point "a technical document that probably goes beyond most people's heads" I'm not sure, but I agree that this raise a question. With respect to "nonstandard" I defintively agree. In fact I was planning to add similar diagrams for other Social network, so that one can easily compare the various feature offered by each one, and I didn't find where to ask for advice for doing that, so I just started with linkedin. As you pointed out "It contains observations, and analysis, of the LinkedIn site, made from and verifiable only by direct examination of the site itself.", so the information is easily verifiable. I would say that the source is linkedin, but I admit that this is questionable. Ok, anyway, thanks for this reply. Is there some place where it would be appropriate to discuss the use of diagram to model concepts. I mean this point has nothing to do with linkedin and it is a much more general issue. Again if this were a piece of text this would not be considered as an issue because it just describes the concepts of linkedin. The fact that it is shown in a compact and graphical way do not fundamentally change its nature. Words and images are of the same nature (dixit magritte). In all cases, just let me know what is the appropriate place to discuss this topic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Valuation">Valuation</span></h2>
<p>Will people <i>please</i> stop removing the $1 billion valuation figure?  Pre and post-money valuations, as established by venture capital investments, are the standard way for reporting valuations of venture-financed companies.  Like it or not, that's how it is.  Deleting them because you think the dot com bubble is too big or the company is overvalued is POV.  It's not an attempt to say what the company is intrinsically worth.  It's a way to report a transaction.  The information is sourced, and more than verifiable - 450+ google news hits worth of verifiability.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://news.google.com/news?q=linkedin%20billion%20valuation&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn">[2]</a>  Thanks,  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">Wikidemo</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:00, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I disagree. The statement taken at face value is that a bunch of VC firms bought a 5% stake at $53 million. That the company is worth $1 billion comes from Linkedin's own PR and then media sites simply reporting it without disputing it. Look at Microsoft's 1.6% stake in Facebook. After the deal happened, Facebook's own press release stated the company was worth $15 billion, and the media took it as fact. It was only until recently, when an ugly lawsuit reared its head was it known that FB later placed a much lower internal valuation at $3.75 billion. And even then, some analysts are arguing that it's still too high because the site has yet to prove that it has a profitable long term business model. The exact same thing applies here. We're not trying to inject our own POV, but you can't simply quote everything as reported straight out of the company's own PR department, either. Unless you have a personal interest in linkedin why do you care so much about this? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wikipedian06&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wikipedian06 (page does not exist)">Wikipedian06</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wikipedian06" title="User talk:Wikipedian06">talk</a>) 02:33, 9 July 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

You mis-cited the source and did the analysis wrong on the Facebook article.  The Wall Street Journal article you quoted used the lawsuit's disclosure of a $3.75B internal valuation as a hook for explaining the issue, not saying there was any dispute or discrepancy.

<h2><span id="New_.22criticisms.22"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="New_&quot;criticisms&quot;">New "criticisms"</span></h2>
<p>I don't think any of the new criticisms are sourced well enough, or relevant enough, to include.  Some of it seems to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR"> original research</a> or opinion of the writer, pointing out a site feature or limitation and saying it is a "criticism".  Other stuff is cited to blogs or commentators, and just isn't very helpful.  You can take almost any feature on any major web service, and find some tech blogger who thinks it is the greatest thing and another who thinks it is evil.  At a minimum, to find fault one would have to source it to significant reliable coverage in major publications, but even there we generally don't repeat critiques and opinions because we're not set up to be a very reliable guide.  It's hard to put in context.  For example, limiting the number and speed of acquiring new friends is something nearly every social network is starting to do.  Facebook limits invitations to 20 per day and has a 5,000 friend limit, which is unrealistically high if you look at the way real social networks work - anyone with 5,000 "friends" is using the feature in a way other than as intended.  If LinkedIn makes a policy change then invariably someone is going to blog about it, but I don't think we can realistically put that in context here in a Wikipedia article.  Best to point someone to the blogs if necessary and let them read it in more detail.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">Wikidemo</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikidemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Wikidemo (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:25, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Influence_of_LinkedIn">Influence of LinkedIn</span></h2>
<p>For a while now, I've thought that this article is relatively short, compared to the influence of LinkedIn (or the potential for influence).  An internet company with a valuation of $1B would seem to be a very hot property.  LinkedIn itself seems somewhat of a mystery to me.  On the one hand, it is worth $1B, and its user base of 25 million puts it in the top 20 of social networking sites.  On the other hand, LinkedIn has only several hundred employees and an Alexa score of 205 (whereas MySpace and FaceBook are in the top 5).  I suspect that there is a deeper influence that LinkedIn is having on business and society that is not captured by its Alexa number or its low corporate profile.  Something seems to be brewing here that many people are missing.  If there are some acceptable sources on this topic, it might be good to add information about this to the article.  --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Westwind273&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Westwind273 (page does not exist)">Westwind273</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Westwind273" title="User talk:Westwind273">talk</a>) 20:09, 22 August 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Most comparable articles pull usage statistics from somewhere, even if they're a matter of interpretation.  The bigger problem is that the article is a hodgepodge of loosely assembled facts about features and staffing, with little flow or meaning.  I'd start by organizing it thematically into sections like company history, features, social impact, etc., and within each a chronological narrative with adequate sourcing and consistent tone.  Step 1 is just moving around sentences and adding headings   Step 2 is to deal with content piece by piece so the work is clear.  There are a number of better written articles about web services companies to use as a model.   - ----</dd></dl>

<p>Hi,
</p><p>I don't see that there is enough controversy to warrant it's own discussion. Recently I reverted the addition of controversy because it seemed wishy washy, but also the source didn't seem too reputable. If there are other sources I am willing to be proven wrong here... I just don't see this controversy in my own research. <a href="/wiki/User:NCSS" title="User:NCSS">NCSS</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:NCSS" title="User talk:NCSS">talk</a>) 20:59, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

First, it is written in a staccato style, with sentences that do not flow well into each other; almost like bullet points without the bullets. Second, several historical occurrences are written in the present tense. The following excerpt, from "Company Background," reflects both issues:
</p>
<dl><dd>"In June 2010, LinkedIn announced it would be opening up a European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.[19]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"In July 2010, Tiger Global Management LLC purchased a 1% stake in the company for $20 million at a valuation of approximately $2 billion.[20]</dd></dl>

The first two examples you cite are indeed stale but are written carefully to avoid the verb tense problem.  The first is completely obsolete, because a comprehensive account of their office locations would track when they actually expanded, not what they announced.  The second is a reasonable event to mention, but may need to be put in context.

<p>As per sign up process for a newcomer, it is required to give full email address and its corresponding passwords. This allows LinkedIn to assess the account's address book directly to "suggest" people on the list to be invited to join the network.

<dd>There should be a section in the article on privacy.  This is definitely an area of concern with Linked-In.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_Graph">Economic Graph</span></h2>
<p>I suggest that a section on LinkedIn's "economic graph" project be added to the article, as LinkedIn execs have been quoted as stating that the initiative is a critical element of the company's plans and how they are organizing. Rather than touching the page directly I'm making the suggestion here as I am not NPOV on LinkedIn. I work for an agency that supports LinkedIn's communications team. I've drafted up a shot at suggested language with citations for an additional subsection on the economic graph that could be placed within the "Features" section - below. If anyone who regularly edits the page would be willing to look it over, work with me on any changes to make it best suited to improving the page's value, and then make the update on my behalf, I'd be extremely grateful.
</p><p><b>Economic Graph</b>
</p><p>LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner stated in November 2012 that the company's vision for the next decade is to construct an "economic graph." The company describes the economic graph as a comprehensive digital map of the global economy and the connections therein. (ZDNet) Using open-source data technologies (TC) and a growing collection of member data, LinkedIn's hope is that over time it becomes a graph of every professional, company, job, (BI) skill, and educational institution in the world. (Forbes) 
</p><p>According to Weiner, the initiative's ultimate goal is "to remove as much friction from that graph as possible, to allow human and economic capital to flow where it's most needed." (BI) Over time, the economic graph might be able to identify skills gaps between companies and workers, and help bridge these gaps to reduce unemployment. (CNBC) As an example, Weiner outlined how a growing company might use the economic graph to evaluate workforce skills in a certain area. With this knowledge, the company could then promote resources to foster needed skills in potential future employees. (CNET)

The company describes the economic graph, in its finalized form, as a comprehensive digital map of the global economy and the connections therein. (ZDNet 1) The project is an evolution of LinkedIn's current platform rather than a totally separate endeavor. (LI Today) At present the graph is composed of LinkedIn’s network of professionals, companies, jobs, (BI 1) skills (Forbes), volunteer opportunities (TC), educational institutions (NPR) and content (Forbes). While these nodes already exist, LinkedIn’s long-term plan is to make the graph comprehensive in each of those categories, worldwide. (LI Today) As of May 2014, LinkedIn has more than 300 million members (BI 2), 3.5 million company profiles, more than 300,000 jobs, more than 3 billion endorsements, more than 24,000 schools, and billions of network updates. (LI SlideShare)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Most recently, the company designed its "Galene" search architecture as a way of giving users access to the economic graph's data. LinkedIn has stated that Galene will enable more thorough filtering of data, via user searches like "Engineers with Hadoop experience in Brazil." (VB, ZDNet 2) Other supporting developments include additional data provided by new and current users (LI blog) and new nodes (the Volunteer Marketplace (TC) and university pages (NPR)) for gathering other categories of information. According to Weiner, the initiative's ultimate goal is to make the global economy (with a focus on the job market) more efficient through increased transparency.

<p>Hi all, in the nine months since the "Economic Graph" section was first added to this article the project has developed quite a bit, so I wanted to check in about updating/adding to the section. As mentioned above, I'm making the request here rather than editing myself because I have a COI: I work for a communications agency that represents LinkedIn. Here's what I suggest adding:
</p>
<dl><dd>Insight from the Economic Graph has influenced research on various employment-related topics, including popular destination cities of recent college graduates (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://qz.com/216560/the-most-attractive-cities-worldwide-for-new-graduates/">source</a>), areas with high concentrations of technology skills (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/24/where-is-the-top-city-to-spot-tech-talent/">source</a>), and common career transitions (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/12/08/how-to-predict-your-next-job/">source</a>). LinkedIn provided the City of New York with data from the Economic Graph that highlighted “in-demand" tech skills to help inform the city's "Tech Talent Pipeline" project. (sources: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2015/02/12/linkedin-economic-graph-research-helping-new-yorkers-connect-with-the-jobs-of-tomorrow-infographic/">1</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-tech-jobs-new-york-2015-2">2</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/how-big-data-could-make-job-hunting-less-stressful/2015/03/13/9b1aab10-c9b6-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816_story.html">3</a>) In March 2015, President Obama announced a technology training initiative for which LinkedIn will provide similar data. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/how-big-data-could-make-job-hunting-less-stressful/2015/03/13/9b1aab10-c9b6-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816_story.html">source</a>)</dd></dl>

<p>The Linkedin profile is an important component of a successful modern person and a prerequisite for the applicant in the job search process, as it indicated here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://linkedinprofilewritingservice.com/">https://linkedinprofilewritingservice.com/</a>. It is necessary to add a section on the Linkedin resume profile to the article, since this is an important aspect of using Linkedin capabilities.
</p><p>Hi friends,
I'm personally involved in the following issue so I'll just explain the reality and would let you guys decide if it warrants a mention.
The crux of what took place can be read <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://medium.com/@itaileshem/the-inconceivable-account-of-a-whistle-blower-destroying-a-tech-giant-e79d9a4cccf3">here</a>, please be aware that you have links from that article to the entire story originally published in several articles on my LinkedIn account. As was probably advised to LinkedIn by its legal people they have not deleted my articles there because that would put them in greater risk once this story gets headlines.
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read it.
