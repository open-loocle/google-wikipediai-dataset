<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="paypal_backlash">paypal backlash</span></h2>
<p>There's a huge backlash against PayPal that should be mentioned in presenting a fair picture of this phenomenon.  The backlash comes both from PayPal buyers and sellers who have been burned by not only PayPal's system, but their notoriously apathetic representatives.  Some allege that they have lost thousands of dollars because of PayPal.  Sites include www.nopaypal.com and literally dozens of others.
</p><p>I think this should be included in "Criticism"-- discussing PayPal's commissions(business fees for credit card transactions) in combination with eBay's fees (initial value, listing fee, final price commission). PayPal has become disgustingly adept at ripping off its customers, and something needs to be given mention-- about the ridiculousness of their fees... ~nz
</p><p>Some editors see this as POV and attacks so once it's made to look like it's not, they will leave it in.  The three main anti-paypal sites are: www.nopaypal.com , www.paypalsucks.org , and www.paypalwarning.com .  nopaypal.com actually redirects to paypalsucks.com (a different site than the .org one) and a name without sucks tends to make editors feel it is not an attack site (at least compared to sucks in the name).  The sites do have good evidence--and paypalsucks.org quotes things right from paypal's website.  <a href="/wiki/User:DyslexicEditor" class="mw-redirect" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 18:08, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span id="paypal_ownership.2C_and_monopoly_control"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="paypal_ownership,_and_monopoly_control">paypal ownership, and monopoly control</span></h2>
<p>PayPal is now owned by Ebay.  These facts, as well as the facts that Ebay is a monopoly in online auctions, and PayPal has a growing monopoly as a payment processor for Ebay auctions.  This monopoly was in place before Ebay purchase PayPal, and has only been reinforced since Ebay acquired PayPal.  It is much more complicated for both buyer and seller to use any other form of payment besides PayPal.
</p>
<dl><dd>I pay most items I buy on eBay using normal national and international bank transfers to the seller's bank account.  To me this is less complicated than using PayPal, and in most cases also means less total fees, both for the sender and for the recepient.  However, some sellers (mainly American) only offer weird and highly expensive kinds of payment options, such as cheques, or payment options unavailable in Europe, such as money orders, so when buying from an American seller I usually have to use PayPal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="site_outages">site outages</span></h2>
<p>How long has PayPal been down? It should probably be mentioned if they were closed or something like that. I have been unable to send money from any computer for several months, but can find no evidence that the shutdown ever occurred.

<p>Shouldn't we add something about the rather high fees that pp charges?
have we been over this one already?
</p>
<dl><dd>PayPal's fee structure is actually pretty good, especially considering the lower volume levels for the majority of its audience. check a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://merchantcalculator.com/">comparison calculator for merchant account rates</a> if you'd like to see what the market charges. full disclosure: i worked for PayPal from 2001 to 2004; but on this issue i'm not concerned about any bias i may have... really, the rates aren't high.  in fact, they're best in class for a lot of low volume scenarios).<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 05:27, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_issues">Legal issues</span></h2>
<p>I created a section titled <b>Legal issues</b> and moved the paragraph on bank regulation into it. I also wrote up a second paragraph in the section, regarding the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.settlement4onlinepayments.com/">class action lawsuit</a> against PayPal. I encourage people to take a look at the section with an eye towards (a) coming up with a better section heading (if necessary); (b) providing more background/detail on the lawsuit; and (c) possibly providing some cohesiveness between the two paragraphs in the section, I assume the issues are related. - <a href="/wiki/User:Walkiped" title="User:Walkiped">Walkiped</a> 20:07, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Katrina_donations">Katrina donations</span></h2>
<p>SomethingAwful set up a Payapl account for donations. They recieved over $20,000 from various users, and then Paypal shut it down without explanation. Should this be in the article if the situation isn't resolved?
</p>
<dl><dd>This isn't the first time Paypal has closed an account, and it's closure was likely automated. I don't think it should be a part of the article, regardless of how big a fuss goons create.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I think it should stay. It's a great example of the way Paypal does business, whether it was an automated freeze or not.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Agreed. Paypal is a business which has little to no customer support.  This is an example of how they treat their customers and as such is relevant to the article. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyLittle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CrazyLittle (page does not exist)">CrazyLittle</a> 06:51, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>um, i don't know where you're getting your facts from; more than half of PayPal overall staff headcount is in customer service.  the PayPal customer support team in Omaha has over 1,000 employees (probably closer to 2,000 these days, i left a year ago), and i believe eBay customer support in Salt Lake City is of equivalent if not larger size.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>So what you're saying is, they employ lots of people who don't do their jobs.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>nope, not what i'm saying -- i was providing factual observations, rather than subjective assessment.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>one customer service example doesn't provide the empirical evidence necessary to support the sweeping statement made above earlier, and my note provided further numeric evidence to contradict a factually INcorrect assertion that had been made.  whether or not they "do their jobs" is a qualitative / subjective assessment that's probably based a lot more on perspective than fact.  regardless, i don't think the earlier statements are made from NPOV.<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 08:44, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Paypal certainly is the company with the lousiest customer support I’ve encountered. &#160;% of staff in customer support is hardly indicative of quality seeing as the business is nigh on fully automated. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Bombot&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bombot (page does not exist)">Bombot</a> 11:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>it's quite possible that either bureaucracy and/or a negligent customer service agent contributed to the unfortunate situation noted above, but to say PayPal has 'little or no customer support' is quite inaccurate.<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 08:02, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>So, after all this debate, why isn't this in this entry?  It's in the entry for <a href="/wiki/Something_Awful" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>.  This controversy should be stated without POV.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bias">Bias</span></h2>
<p>I think the part of article about PayPal blocking the donations to the Red Cross is quite unfairly biased against PayPal. People seem to have ignored the fact that PayPal needs to take measures to protect itself from fraud and I think they acted quite reasonably.
</p><p>Something Awful started accepting donations on Friday. Now, PayPal's offices, like most businesses would most likely be closing for the weekend so getting a human to deal with this would likely be more trouble. 
</p><p>The account collected $30,000 in only 9 hours. I don't think these are unreasonable circumstances for PayPal's computers to flag the account as suspicious for it to be investigated further by a human. Kyanka says he "no chance to fix anything." What if this account was owned by a phisher with credit card details to hand that was linked to a bank account opened in a false name and address? Should PayPal keep the account open and merely ask him to "explain"? Of course not, in this case the funds would be instantly transferred away from PayPal leaving them with $30,000 of chargebacks!
</p><p>Now when this happened, Kyanka, after writing an article about how much PayPal sucks he got in touch with them. From Kyanka's posts on his website there's no evidence to show that they ever said Kyanka couldn't give the money to the Red Cross if he just waited, but Kyanka asked them to give the money to United Way. After deciding that United Way wasn't a suitable charity instead of asking them to restore the account so he could transfer the money he asked PayPal to refund all the donations. I think a lot of this situation could have been avoided if Kyanka had handled things differently.
</p><p>The article also mentions that people donating got less back than what they paid. This is what happens when money is exchanged from one currency to another, this is called an exchange rate, I hardly think we can blame PayPal for this.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Brilliant words from someone who obviosly works for PayScam. Get lost idiot.

<p>Nothing in the article touches upon that most basic of points. I have no clue myself. Credit check? Do two people need an account? Etc. <a href="/wiki/User:Mithridates" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 18:06, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I checked out this article because their site doesn't state how it works. Which is ludicrous. There's lots of stuff about how brilliant they are but hardly anything on how it actually works. This makes me very suspicious. It feels like a scam. But the thing is Paypal is the only way to pay for certain things. Which makes me even more suspicious. Monopolies in private hands don't make the most reliable businesses, especially when the monopoly is worldwide. A potential new Microsoft, except these guys deal with money directly. Sounds very scary. <a href="/wiki/User:DirkvdM" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 06:53, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I've tried to make a payment through them in several ways, but failed. So I contacted them and got a very lengthy standardised reply that didn't answer my question (which was pretty straightforward <i>and</i> very essential). Their customer support does indeed seem to be non-existent. <a href="/wiki/User:DirkvdM" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 17:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="This_article_needs_to_be_re-written">This article needs to be re-written</span></h2>
<p>The point of any encyclopedia is to present factual data in an objective manner. The "Criticisms" area presents criticisms in a critical, rather than objective way. This is slanted and biased, only showing the failure of the author of the section, as well as the Katrina section, to provide a balanced perspective of the issues given as well as a lack of any understanding of the banking and financial industries.

</p><p>Not all of those stories are false, but many of them are quite dated and a bit extreme in perspective (though in a few cases, perhaps not without cause).  full-disclosure: i used to work for PayPal from 2001-2004 so i'm probably biased.  you might want to investigate the details of the Eliot Spitzer settlement and customer service class action lawsuits that resulted in changes to PayPal's TOU (Terms of Use) and revised policies on freezing / unfreezing customer accounts.  
</p><p>in general, most customer service issues arise from either a) forgotten password / account info, and b) PayPal's fraud prevention efforts which were probably a bit heavy-handed in the early days (and with good reason; there were millions of dollars in fraud in those days while they were still getting some of the systems &amp; policies up to snuff).  
</p><p>when people forgot their passwords, PayPal usually required they verify a number of detailed personal ID items to re-enable access.  some folks didn't like this, but in many cases it was necessary to make sure fraudsters didn't get access to other people's accounts &amp; access to their credit card or bank accounts.  
</p><p>similarly, when questionable transactions arose that had some potential fraud characteristics, sometimes the result was often to place a temporary (and in a few cases, not so temporary) freeze on a customer account until more information could be verified.  some customers who had this happen didn't appreciate this approach, and in a few cases where funds were frozen for a long time (or a large amount), some people became angry, persistent critics of the company.<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 19:31, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I worked at PayPal from 2001-2004, however i wasn't around when the larger fraud incidents occurred... although i did hear a lot of the war stories from that time.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Incidents of fraud still occur regularly for most popular internet payment sites, however during the 1999-2001 timeframe many of the new only payment startups were being ravaged by fraud.  These incidents caused a number of online payment startups to hemorrhage funds, and a lot of them went bankrupt and/or had to shut down.  PayPal was no exception, and in the summer of 2000 (not sure on exact dates) there a number of efforts by russian mafia (among others) that resulted in multi-million dollar losses.  Unlike many of their competitors, PayPal eventually got a handle on it, and implemented stronger anti-fraud systems to deter future large losses, however they did have a rough time of it that summer.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>For more detail on this, you should read the PayPal Wars book, or contact the author Eric Jackson at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.worldaheadpublishing.com/contact/index.php">World Ahead Publishing</a>.<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 19:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the info.  I was wondering how were these companies stealing from paypal?  Was paypal just anti-money laundering?  Were people paying with credit card, taking out the funds, then the payer filing a chargeback?</dd>
<dd>As for the book, my library is closing all their branches in January for remodelling so I can't get it till February.  Do you know how exactly they were stealing from paypal?  It doesn't seem possible.  (This info should go in the article, too).  <a href="/wiki/User:DyslexicEditor" class="mw-redirect" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 01:40, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>i don't have all the details, but there were several scams &amp; variations.  usually it involved a stolen credit card (cc numbers are available for sale on many black market BBSs) or some other compromised financial instrument attached to a PayPal account, and then either the funds would be sent to another PayPal account where they were withdrawn, or used to buy other goods which were later laundered.  this also might be daisy-chained thru several accounts.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>in the past 5 years PayPal has gotten a lot more sophisticated at detecting and preventing these scams, however as with other white hat / black hat battles it's an ongoing affair.  these days i believe they've gotten fraud down to &lt;0.5% of payment volume, which is pretty good considering normal physical world transactions typically have 1-2% fraud rates.  anyway, i'm probably rusty on the exact story, but i'm sure if you email Eric he can help provide more info too.<a href="/wiki/User:Davemc500hats" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 07:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I removed this text:
</p>
<dl><dd>Ebay has previously stated that it is just a venue. After acquiring paypal it has become more than a venue by listing in auctions whether the buyer accepts paypal (no other payment options listed) and allowing buyers to sort by paypal. Next, Paypal accounts that are frozen without it being the seller's fault (sometimes frozen without reason) have resulted in ebay accounts being banned [7]. In August 2005, it required that sellers who take paypal not refuse credit card payments, which result in fees and may result in chargebacks due to credit card and other buyer fraud. Beginning in January 2006, ebay now prohibits any online payment system except Paypal, as stated here. Ebay deceptively gives bidpay.com as an alternative, but bidpay has already gone out of business. This singularly requires that online payments through ebay must use ebay's system. Issues of illegality and antitrust have been raised over this decision. [8] Ebay specifically prohibits E-gold, a legitimate competitor to Paypal.</dd></dl>
<p>Please feel free to reinsert it after rewording it to sound less like an anti-eBay rant and more like a proper encyclopedia entry.  Thanks.

<p>While there are obviously bad issues with Paypal, PayPalSucks and PayPalWarning are, IMHO, not sites which should be linked in the article. Many of their stories sound like blatant fabrication, and they particulary have a tendency to blatantly advertise competing services. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.paypalsucks.com/paypal-banner-2.gif">example1</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://j.b5z.net/i/u/2078993/i/paypal-problems-image-7.gif">example2</a>. 
</p><p>They also do exhibit some censorship of logical Pro-PayPal arguments (personal experience), and there is the point in fact they have had legal dealings with eBay and PayPal in the past. Some of their stories are exact duplicates or ad libs apon closer investigation, they all share quite some level of ...fanaticism would be a good word, and they do have traces of fairly blatant spamming.
</p><p>Perhaps it is all to maintain a clear image and ensure the fiscal maintenance of the site, and all the keyword hogging may be just to make sure that the site gets the attention which is 'so urgently needed'. I do not know. However, it may be in best interest to find a more (competition/advertising) neutral site which has critism of PayPal.

<p>"...one of the leading fraud prevention systems in the industry, ... dedicated to customer service ... a safe, global, real-time payment solution...". This is the kind of language you hear in a commercial. Not very encyclopedic. Better would be to say how many people they employ and then maybe specify how many in each department, although that doesn't seem necessary. But certainly not a phrase like "dedicated to customer service". This is not supposed to be a commercial. So I removed some bits. Stating "leading fraud prevention" once is quite enough. And the employee-bit needs to be more encyclopedic. There are also way too many links to the company's website. I count a total of 31! That;s a bit over the top isn't it? Especially if many are double. So I deleted some of those too. But some more pruning would be in place. <a href="/wiki/User:DirkvdM" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:43, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Additionally, sellers who use credit cards can authorize a <a href="/wiki/Chargeback" title="Chargeback">chargeback</a> for a payment used to fund their PayPal account that went to purchase the service up to six months after the date of the charge.  For PayPal merchants that provide monthly services, PayPal will collect some basic information to contest the charge on behalf of the merchant with the credit card issuer.  But in real world experience, PayPal rarely if ever succeeds in getting the chargeback reversed because the credit card transaction was deemed a "card not present" transaction.  Until January of 2005, PayPal protected its merchants by allowing them to prevent a transaction funded by a credit card to be accepted as a payment.  Since PayPal removed this feature, fraud against its merchants has skyrocketed.  Because PayPal's fees and volume increased when they removed this option, management doesn't care about their merchants' increased fraud rate, the cost of which falls entirely on the merchant."  <a href="/wiki/User:Bordello" title="User:Bordello">Bordello</a> 14:07, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

Looking for news online about paypal, though, there doesn't seem to be anything but complaints.

Another thing to consider is the fact that the media rarely does "X business is having a good day today" stories.  They only write about something when the crap hits the fan. They enjoy creating <a href="/wiki/FUD" class="mw-redirect" title="FUD">FUD</a> its basically how they operate. That being said I find it best to limit external links to one of a kind. I.e. one covering phishing, one covering customer complaints, etc. If there is an unusual amount of news stories or other credible sites covering a specific issue, perhaps another 1 or 2 links for that issue (depending on the size of the external links).

<dl><dd>I just checked them too. paypalcomplaints.com says "Site Temporarily Disabled. This site has been temporarily disabled. If you are the owner of the site, please contact customer care." "Screwed by paypal" is a blog, and we generally don't have those as external links, as they are not even remotely reliable sources. We simply don't allow attack sites, which fuckpaypal obviously is.

<dd>They can be used as external links but can't be used to support facts, opinions, theories, or conclusions in the article.

<p>Hm, I didn't realize which sites we were advocating here. This makes things more comlpicated. I'm sure "Screwed By Paypal" will eventually become a news story, but that's my speculation-- in other words, it's popular, and it may even be important, but, hm, what standard do we use? If we're not going to wikilawyer this whole issue, it doesn't seem completely wrong to put it up, even considering that it is blog-like in nature.
</p><p>I'm still for having a list of critical sites, but what would qualify them as NPOV? There simply doesn't appear to be any cool secondary source which will expand on these very real problems people are having, which Paypal, as most companies, will not publish either. I think there is always room for the dissenting minority and would not mind seeing at least a couple pages with caveats using Paypal. -<a href="/wiki/User:Bordello" title="User:Bordello">Bordello</a> 16:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The dissenting minority rarely tries to stay as such. they try to push PoV through slowly expanding external sites, introducing a little bit into the article etc. The minority has to be significant though in order to be covered according to NPOV.  Wiki-lawyering, Ignore all Rules, etc are fine to bring up in certain situations, but they shouldn't be used as a catch-all to run over corner-stone principals like <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Otherwise why have them? Its fine if we have some credible sources on which to base a part of the article around phishing, scams, etc, but using subjective self-published sites to do that isn't the write way to go about it. Are we trying to say that some people hate paypal, or are we trying to say that scamming can occur with paypal? --<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I don't think either of those is the issue. Paypal does have some serious business practice and customer service issues in its history (and perhaps in its present -- I'm not up to date), and, as I've said, it would be worth mentioning this things in the article in some or another NPOV fashion. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 00:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>And in order to do so, we need to find the proper references and citations to support it. Just because we know it exists doesn't mean we can turn around and use any old website to support the material.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>If we are going to remove the critical sites, shouldn't we remove the link in the Criticism section? I've been waiting for someone to notice.
<dl><dd>Sure, you can do that any time you want. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jpgordon" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jpgordon" title="User talk:Jpgordon">&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;</a></small></sup> 04:32, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>What you are saying makes no sense! How can someone criticize something while keeping a neutral point of view? If PayPal were to screw someone over to the point of financial loss and frustration, it would be hard for them to prove their point that what PayPal did was wrong if they were trying to keep a neutral point of view. 17:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Actually they can easily prove they had a problem without coming across as an attack site.

If all you good folks will direct your attention here: <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:PayPal#External_links_.3D_spam.3F">[3]</a>, I think we can realize a more reasonable solution. So what it is is we need some critical views and not extremely slanted ones, ie most news sources will do, but most blogs will not. It's not a matter of citing sources and the like, I don't think, but allowing for a comprehensive and as close to objective analysis of PayPal's function as possible. So it comes to this; you see those news sources I cited earlier above (which I forgot about), they reflect many complaints the very vocal critical sites had in a reletively aplomb fashion. In other words, those other critical sites, though maybe a helpful warning, etc., are not even needed if alls we want is the information.

<dl><dd>That doesn't really change anything. Whether it came from the place I pointed to, or the one you pointed to, the nature of both sites make me question it greatly.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:07, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Can you share with me what you mean by the nature of both sites?  What is it you are looking for?  Sorry I'm confused and don't understand, thanks for your help.  --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ibroker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ibroker (page does not exist)">Ibroker</a> 11:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Both of those sites do not look trusthworthy to me. I'm not sure if there is any precedent for usage of those sites (sometimes they hold discussions about various sites on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>) but I personally would find anything to come out of either of those pages to be suspect. They both seem to be created from the viewpoint of driving traffic to a blog or site and their job is to create articles that would do that, which often means focusing more on keywords and thigns like that rather than writing a good quality and researched article.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="many_major_issues_missing">many major issues missing</span></h2>
<p>...such as near monopoly status, de facto competition (merchant accounts), major spam/scam victim/bait, phishing, PayPal's security tips...!
</p><p>The article incorrectly claims <i>Most of PayPal’s major competitors have phased out</i>, when in fact there is the viable and at least for vendors apparently much better alternative of a merchant account. Someone with more insight should explain that this exists and what it is. 
</p><p>Also, does anyone know something about www.free-merchant.com and whether it should be added here and in <a href="/wiki/Merchant_account" title="Merchant account">merchant account</a>?
</p><p>Why was www.paypalwarning.com removed? It was called informative (due to the case stories) in other informed comments above. At the very least, it should be mentioned and commented on in the article, especially if it is itself not trustworthy.

</p><p>Brujo, it's not a good idea to just delete something you don't agree with, especially when you yourself notice that it was written in good faith and with an obvious effort to present an issue neutrally, objectively, and fairly. Just because much PayPal criticism is expressed in a crazy manner doesn't mean it's not based on true events. You simply deleted the following summary of that criticism; instead, please reformulate it in a way that you feel is better:
</p><p><i>This is however both understandable and excusable considering that the criticism is usually expressed not by professionals but by private individuals who feel helpless against a huge monopoly. In addition, as with most other monopolies, there are in fact alternatives such as <a href="/wiki/Merchant_account" title="Merchant account">merchant accounts</a> to PayPal, but these are not widely known.</i>
</p><p>The same is true of my explanation of PayPal's near-monopoly status and the effect this has on criticism and the alternatives to this monopoly. Simply deleting all of that information is a very bad idea and a sign of very sloppy editing! --<a href="/wiki/User:Espoo" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 07:14, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Brujo, this edit of yours is no solution and in fact illogical:
<i>PayPal has been the target of criticism due to its dominant position in the market. Much of this criticism has been the result of fraud by third parties which PayPal has no control over. This fraud has in turn led to restrictive policies on the part of PayPal which sometimes causes problems for legitimate customers or sellers.</i>
</p><p>The fraud and PayPal's reactions to it is not the main cause of the criticism. First of all, monopolies always create a hate community, even when they respect their customers and don't let themeselves be corrupted by greed and power, which rarely happens. Secondly, the criticism is mainly caused by PayPal's bad customer support and apparently generally negligent attitude towards complaints. The problem is that all monopolies think they don't have to take crackpots or even normal customers with a special problem seriously. Because there's no competition, they only deal with problems that affect many customers. Sears, for example, has a much smarter attitude to rare or even crazy problems and complaints: by even letting crackpots bring back 15-year-old sofas, they get a very good image and nearly free advertising. Normal, sane customers feel confident to buy and buy much more because they're sure they can take anything back if there's a problem. PayPal is apparently like Microsoft in just not giving a damn about individuals and their problems unless there are many with the same problem. --<a href="/wiki/User:Espoo" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 07:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Brujo, do you work for PayPal? <i>This is advantageous because PayPal charges a lot less than a competative merchant account from a traditional bank, and is a lot easier to obtain</i> is at least very bad editing because it doesn't just have a spelling error but is in fact blatant advertisement for PayPal since you combined it with the deletion mentioned above... --<a href="/wiki/User:Espoo" title="User:Espoo">Espoo</a> 07:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I still do not see how we can have a PayPal site that is critical without being 'biased.' A site with sources to back it up should be more than enough. Yes, I know <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>.. Blah, blah. It will just be near impossible to find a site that criticizes PayPal, but keeps it neutral as well. Most people that have had problems with PayPal have to deal with FINANCIAL LOSS. When you mess with someone's money and they want to tell other people about it, it's hard for them to say that a site can also be amazing. With that in mind, we have a link to a page where people give their opinions to PayPal. Isn't that link then incorrect? The people who are leaving comments are not providing sources to back up those comments... <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:68.193.81.111&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:68.193.81.111 (page does not exist)">68.193.81.111</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:68.193.81.111" title="User talk:68.193.81.111">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/68.193.81.111" title="Special:Contributions/68.193.81.111">contribs</a>) 00:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</span></small></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Crossmr, i hope you agree that this article should mention that PayPal has a near-monopoly status, and not just in a comment in the section "Acquisition by eBay". I hope you also agree that the article should mention that there are alternatives instead of indirectly advertising PayPal as the only choice. I hope you also agree that an article about PayPal should mention that the company's name and website imitation is one of the most common baits used in spam and phishing, which i'll call PayPal fraud here. I can see your point about Wikipedia not being a how-to guide, but the fact that you even object to a link that explains how to prevent PayPal fraud and a one-sentence description of that link shows that you're really exaggerating in your interpretation of Wikipedia guidelines.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Wikipedia is supposed to be much more than a fuddy-duddy paper encyclopedia with only boring and old facts about a company. The vast majority of Wikipedia users come into contact with the name PayPal not as customers of the company but as recipients of email spam fraudulently claiming to come from PayPal. It's simply ridiculous not having any mention of spam or phishing in a Wikipedia article on PayPal. Probably most Wikipedia users that look up this article are looking for info on this very aspect, including PayPal's attitude and reaction towards this spam and fraud. Basically, you've ignored what i said to Brujo, and what i said about the quality of his work as a Wikipedia editor applies to you too:</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Let's take this one issue at a time, Crossmr. I hope you agree that this article should mention that PayPal has a near-monopoly status, and not just in a comment on the side in the section "Acquisition by eBay". The information that PayPal has near-monopoly status is essential to an objective and informative encyclopedia article. Deleting that information is not careful editing; if you didn't like the wording, you could have rephrased it.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I hope you also agree that the article should mention that there are alternatives instead of indirectly advertising PayPal as the only choice, as the article is now doing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rewards">Rewards</span></h2>
<p>Paypal accounts can earn interest and the debit card they issue gets 1% cash back on all transactions processed as a credit card.
