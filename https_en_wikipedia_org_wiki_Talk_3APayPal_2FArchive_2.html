</p><p>Third paragraph "The company—by its own admission—uses automated systems to verify tracking numbers." I was not able to find where the company says that if the seller does not enter the correct tracking number, the seller will loose the claim without having a human being look at it. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ntt_ng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ntt ng (page does not exist)">Ntt ng</a> 06:01, 16 August 2007 (UTC).
</p><p>This can be found in the statement "of a former employee" as found on www.screw-paypal.com and other sites. Accounts are frozen by authomatics algorithms /like used in banking institutes" but adjusted more sharp. The software is called Ivan and Irena. The former paypal-employee states that there is onel ONE PERSON deciding about account un-freezement fpr the whole uS:
</p><p>This also fits the Ebay logistics where only very few persons are allowed to make decisions but follow up helpdesk guidelines also for the employees.
I don't see the sources of the criticism about the policies. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ntt_ng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ntt ng (page does not exist)">Ntt ng</a> 06:01, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

<p>This happens cause any potentially illegal account gets frozen (paypal encashing interrst and fees then, in some of the cases just the amount in total until state authorities claim it- if ever noticed...) and paypal employees can have options and assets in paypal- so every frozen account increases their personal stock options/ shares value.

<p>I was pointed out that "frozen accounts" is regarded as a problem with paynet - and googled a bit around it.
</p><p>I came over the website <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.paypalsucks.com/">paypalsucks.com</a> - which particularly critices paypal for:
</p>
<ul><li>having unfair Terms of Service</li>
<li>having an understaffed customer support department</li>
<li>frozen account problem.  It seems like PayPal automatically closes accounts (and funds!) on suspicions of fraud.  Innocent people get their accounts frozen from time to time, and when this happens, it is very difficult to get ones money back.</li>
<li>customers are beeing "ripped off", chargeback risk and credit card fees are beeing used as an argument for having high charges on transactions - but those charges are applied to any transactions, regardless of whether it's credit card transactions or not.</li></ul>
<p>I suppose at least the frozen accounts problem, plus a link to the paypalsucks site would be appropriate.

<p>Criticism would be perfectly acceptable if it was published in a reliable source.  A BBC or CNN article about Paypal fraud or something along those lines would be reasonable.  A site that simply lists complaints that people have made is not acceptable because there is no way to verify that the information provided is accurate. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:74.114.148.69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:74.114.148.69 (page does not exist)">74.114.148.69</a> 21:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>"Criticism would be perfectly acceptable if it was published in a reliable source." And not just a "reliable" source, but, indeed, a journalistic, scholastic or other legitimate Secondary Source (per WP: NOR). As for the attack sites, it would be relevant to make links to news sources which document a PayPalSucks.com (for example), but it is questionable whether to put a link to the site itself on here. It is germane to the topic at hand, which is PayPal, it does represent a significant problem with the processing, but it is, after all, a fringe voice. So, I think a fair compromise would be to add a link to a second-source website accounting for PayPal's problems with payment processing and which may bring up an "attack" site, link to the PayPalSucks.com wikipedia page (because it is relevant) and to address what major criticisms have been brought up in secondary sources (which is already done.)

</p><p>Why has the Criticism section been deleted and replaced by Accolades? I had posted a valid, constructive criticism. I sell products on line, and whenever somebody orders several products by Paypal, only the first 100 characters come through. The rest of the lines are lost, and if the person can't remember their whole order, we have to improvise, which is an uncompensated waste of our time. Wouldn't it be easier for Paypal to fix this ridiculous glitch, rather than having their minions suppress justified criticism which could improve their operation?

<p>"PayPal account holders must be 18 or over with a debit/credit card or bank account and an e-mail address."
</p><p>Please check the correctness of this.  Why is either a card or a bank account needed?  PayPal offers several ways both to add and to withdraw funds:
Adding funds:
</p>
<ul><li>Using a card (credit/debit)</li>
<li>By having PayPal charge the money from a bank account (available in some countries only, such as the United States)</li>
<li>By paying in cash at a bank account, post office or similar (available in some countries only, such as Sweden)</li>
<li>By transferring the bank from your bank account to PayPal's bank account (available in some countries only, such as Sweden)</li></ul>
<p>Withdrawing funds:
</p>
<ul><li>Money inserted to a bank account (available in some countries only)</li>
<li>Cheque sent out by mail (available in some countries only)</li></ul>
<p>If you only send money, and you pay in cash at a bank, why do you need either a bank account or a card?
If you only receive money, and you receive the money as a cheque, why do you need either a bank account or a card?  Or, let's say that you receive money from others, and then spend all of that money on other things, and spend no money other than the money you receive using PayPal, why do you need a bank account or a card?

</p><p>Because PayPal forces you to "verify" your address and to do that, they want either your credit card or bank account number. If you don't want to give this info, or you don't have either, they refuse to give you your money if you have any in your account.(<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:75.21.163.212&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:75.21.163.212 (page does not exist)">75.21.163.212</a> 08:17, 27 February 2007 (UTC))
</p><p>Please note that a bank account or a credit card is not a "MUST". users can open accounts, receive money and spend the money without having a bank account or a credit/debit card, however, they MUST be 18 yo and have an email address. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ntt_ng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ntt ng (page does not exist)">Ntt ng</a> 06:09, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>In some countries (such as Sweden) you can either pay using a card, or add funds to your PayPal balance using a giro transfer (which can be performed by filling in a piece of paper and going to a bank office and pay in cash).  You only need a bank account to <b>withdraw</b> money.  Adding funds without a bank account or card is only possible in some countries, though.
</p><p>In some countries (such as the United States) you can withdraw funds using a cheque.  You can then go to the issuing bank and have it cashed directly over the desk (I suppose) and thus withdraw money directly in cash without first having to deposit it in a bank account.  This option is only available in some countries, though. (<a href="/wiki/User:Stefan2" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Stefan2">Stefan2</a> 22:53, 12 May 2007 (UTC))

<p>I'm surprised a lengthy article like this is lacking a description of the basic functioning of this service. All it says is that PayPal "serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as cheques and money orders", "performs payment processing for online vendors, auction sites, and other corporate users, for which it charges a fee" and that it is "licensed as a money transmitter" and is "not a bank". But how does it <i>actually</i> work? How is that "payment processing" and "money transmision" done? I mean, some people like me have never used PayPal, so I have no idea about things such as what kind of information they require from the users to set up an account, what steps they take to transfer the money between buyer and seller, etc. Do PayPal payments work as some kind of online postal giros? Or does PayPal merely serve to hide the user's credit card number from the receiver of the payment, using the PayPal account as a kind of "virtual" credit card? Or do users "recharge" their PayPal accounts with money from their bank accounts and then payments through PayPal are done with the money available in the PayPal account and not directly with the money in the user's bank account? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:213.37.6.106&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:213.37.6.106 (page does not exist)">213.37.6.106</a> 19:57, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

</p><p>To start, I'll note that people are confusing <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>.  They are different guidelines (emphasis on guideline) for different types of content.Reliable sources applies to the content added to Wikipedia (e.g. the writing) and EL is the guideline for links.  In many situations even blatantly biased websites are linked because they either a) have good information or b) represent a certain biased POV well.
</p><p>If you're against PayPalSucks.com, then you might as well go through all of Wikipedia and remove ALL websites critical of a certain subject.  The consensus on Wikipedia is clearly for inclusion of criticism websites as external links and I find it rather disingenuous that a former or current arbcomm member would deliberately take an arbcomm ruling out of context and put it into a context where at best there's no consensus and at worst the consensus is the opposite.
</p><p>Very often when dealing with more technical subjects you need to reference more modern types of sources.  This includes popular blogs (as they represent popular opinion--NPOV requires representing the views that exist based on how widely belived they are, NOT based on how accurate they are) and blog-like website like Slashdot (a quick Googling of Slashdot for PayPal related posts reveals a significant number of critical articles mysteriously missing).
</p><p>If you search other major tech sites you'll get similar information on things involving PayPal freezing accounts and such.  PayPal criticism is woefully underrepresented wrt to NPOV requirements.  Even if praise is too, that is not a valid reason to remove criticism.  Websites like PayPalSucks.com are popular among pay pal websites and as such, represent a popular viewpoint, one that need to be represented and it doesn't amtter how popular it is.
</p><p>Many times even forum posts (and emailing lists) are actually acceptable when more authoritative figures on a subject are speaking in them.  Applying an absoutlist standard to a guideline simply doesn't work.

Its also basically an attack site and we don't link to those. If reliable sources can't be found to source for criticism, then its not woefully underrepresented, that is the point of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It doesn't require that you cover every viewpoint. It requires that you cover every sourceable viewpoint which isn't trivial. If the vast majority of criticism is coming from blogs and other self-published sources which fail <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> it doesn't get covered. Blogs never pass unless the blog is written by the subject of the article. So if paypal starts a blog its a reliable source on paypal. But thats the extent of the usage of blogs as sources on wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and if the websites don't meet the policies and guidelines, we're not going to make exceptions so someone can build a case to support their viewpoint.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 14:31, 9 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>If it were original research, then the same applies to all viewpoints represented which aren't accompanied by scientific opinion polls.  If you look at the various guidelines and policies of Wikipedia, you'll actually see suggestions on how to use various methods of determining the popularity of websites (including PageRank) as subject for inclusion of those websites (note: this is for inclusion of a link or synthesis of the content NOT for inclusion of an analysis of popularity).  You're going against a lot of consensus and guidelines.  Not to mention, this would require taking down massive portions of Wikipedia on virtually all computer related subjects.
</p><p>Websites on opinions are inherently self-verified.  That's not even an issue, unless you're going to suggest that the people on these pages are lying about having their own viewpoints.  The existence of such websites in such numbers and of such popularity must be documented for NPOV purposes.  It is synthesis, not original research to document the existence of a viewpoint.  The accuracy of the viewpoint is 100% irrelevant.
</p><p>You didn't really address my argument, you just repeated your original assertions  Please establish how it fails to me the guidelines of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>--we're talking about external links here, after all, NOT WP:RL.  You can explain how WP:EL doesn't actually apply to external links and how WP:RS suddenly does.
</p><p>Furthermore, consensus has shown that it's acceptable under certain circumstances to link to blogs well beyond what you've stated, including those that a I mentioned--so please present evidence that it doesn't meet the critera for WP:RL and is not a suitable exception.  Why is an official PayPal blog not acceptable, but commentary from a popular blog author not?  Because an organization talking about itself is going to be so unbiased, right?  If you look under the Wikipedia page for 'convenience links,' it actually has arguments specifically against inclusion of such a website.  You should cite parts of guidelines that actually disagree with this.
</p><p>If a view is widely represented on the internet, it would be a egregious violation of NPOV to not even mention it.  You are confusing the existence of opinions with analyzing those opinions.  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 08:57, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Undo weight. People are having trouble finding reliable sources to establish a criticism section. Hence it falls under a minority viewpoint. Self-verified doesn't pass <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> that's not something that is really open for debate to be honest. An organization talking about itself isn't necessarily going to be neutral, but as far as authority goes, they are it. What bob says about bob, true or not, is inherently more reliable than what joe says about bob. On the other hand if Joe is a reliable source, you write "Bob stated this, but Joe, a reliable source stated this about the situation". This doesn't apply in this case. A bunch of random users with an axe to grind on forums and blogs doesn't remotely meet any of the requirements to be included as an external link. There is a reason they're excluded, otherwise every article from one end to the other would be chock full of them. --<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:14, 13 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>You seem to be wanting to avoid the debate entirely by reasserting your viewpoint <a href="/wiki/Argumentum_ad_nauseam" class="mw-redirect" title="Argumentum ad nauseam">argumentum ad nauseam</a> and declaring it not up for debate.  What constitutes a reliable source is a matter of contention, therefore your argument is incomplete since it doesn't establish why it's not a reliable source.  The only thing not up for debate is ignoring consensus, which is what you seem to be doing. 
</p><p>Points you didn't address: why the links don't fall under EL (you simply asserted it without backing it up) and how RS applies to EL, the usage in guidelines of Wikipedia of Google PageRank and other tools in assessing how widespread certain views are (popularity of views is what determines undue weight), how blogs (and other non-traditional-news websites) are inherently disqualified for RS (with your one exception) in spite of consensus to the contrary and no policies stating that.
</p><p>I've seen a massive consensus for adding links which are considered useful to the end of the article which are not RS, especially not in terms of how you're describing it.  If we obeyed your criteria, the majority of links would have to be removed from the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article and by all means, go over there and try to enforce your views and see how far you get.
</p><p>You can take your pick of articles you've edited in the past, especially non-business ones.  What about <a href="/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients" title="Defense of the Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a>?  That one is chock full of citations from random gaming websites.  Those don't meet your criteria of RS.
</p><p>Banning all non-traditional-news and non-study sources would eliminate a massive amount of Wikipedia's content.  Where is the policy that states that all criticism websites are to be banned, by the way?  And we definitely want to get rid of links to websites with multimedia content (e.g. videos) that help explain the material.  That would be like...so against the purpose of teaching people things.  
</p><p>Did you try Googling "PayPal criticisms"?  There are 1.7 million links--it's hardly a rare viewpoint.  Even the first link is "Assessing Criticism of PayPal," a well written assessment of criticisms.
</p><p>How can you call something more reliable while simultaneously disregarding its truth?  Being untruthful is the antithesis of reliability and the whole spirit of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> policy.  So no sources can be an authority on something except that thing itself?  Where is the policy stating this?  Why can't another website be authoritative?
</p><p>This isn't a "bunch of random people," this is NUMEROUS people as evidenced by my search above.  Furthermore, I'm not suggesting including every webpage--that's both a slippery slope and straw man argument.  Including a well written article about the problems with PayPal would be tragic if it didn't come from a traditional news source.

<dl><dd>Google isn't a reliable method for testing reliability. Maybe you should re-read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a>, the threshold for inclusion is verifiability not truth. Maybe that is where your confusion is. The fact remains is no sources which meet <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>. Since there is no reliable criticism of the subject, it becomes a trivial viewpoint. Which is covered under <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> as undue weight and linking to websites on that subject would be improper. It can't be anymore clear than that. Unless we start getting reliable sources covering paypal criticism it doesn't meet the criteria for being included in the article, whether its as a see also, an external link or a section in the article. If other articles have included it, its reason to check those articles for clean-up. The policies and guidelines are quite clear. Self-published forums, websites, blogs and other things of that sort do not qualify for citation. Otherwise for $15 I could whip up citations that say all kinds of things and claim all kinds of popular viewpoints. If it doesn't garner the attention of the professional media they consider it a trivial viewpoint and so do we. The community has established that as its standards. With almost 2 million articles on wikipedia its easy for one or more to slip through the cracks and contain information they shouldn't. This isn't consensus or license to put the same kind of improper information in other articles. The banning of attack websites comes from an arbcom ruling. I believe if you check the archives you can find it. It was previously brought up when that site was removed a long time ago. We're not banning all non-traditional sources. We're disallowing their use for establishing notability of a subject and usefulness as citation. If several reliable sources (i.e. news articles) were written with their focus being criticism of paypal it could then become appropriate to add external links on that subject. Wikipedia is not a soapbox <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a> among many other things, and if the notability of this criticism cannot be established through accepted policies and guidelines it doesn't belong in the article or the external links. We don't artificially create "balance" by adding criticism sections to articles for which there is no notable criticism. The google test was thrown out long ago as a method to establish notability.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:09, 16 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>PaypalSucks is really a website set up to promote their "alternative" merchantinc.com.  Giving a forum for people to attack the market leader can only help having people use their services.</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>crossmr, you keep repeating yourself and are avoiding addressing my arguments.  I never said that the threshold for inclusion is truth.  I'd appreciate it if you read my argument and addressed it directly.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The arbcom ruling was taken out of context and we've already established that.  Repeating it doesn't make it more true.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>How do you plan on evaluating notability (which is the issue for inclusion of external links)?  How to explain away the many guidelines providing methods such as Google for evaluating notability?  Where was the Google test and other tests thrown out as a test for notability (NOT as a citation itself)?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>How aren't published sources verifiable?  You never answered that.  A source where someone or some group publishes their opinion is inherently self-verified.  Again, are you suggesting that these sites are lying about their own opinions?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>What do you mean by "self-published"?  All websites are "published" by the people who run them.  By your standard, PayPal.com and NewYorkTimes.com are "self-published."  No one is referring to a Wikipedian including their own source here, so that's a moot point and would qualify as original research if you did.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>If you were the only one doing it, that definitely wouldn't be a measure of popularity.  How can you equate one single blog existing to numerous blogs existing on a subject as being equal in popularity?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>What policy requires that something be mentioned in a "professional" news source to be notable?  There isn't one.  It seems you're using circular logic--the other sources aren't professional because they're not mentioned in professional sources.  Where is the policy requiring that notability be established only through traditional news sources?  What is "professional" anyway?  There are plenty of blogs and websites written by people who make their income from those blogs/websites and hence are writing professionally.  There are even blogs written by professional writers on major news websites like the Washington Post and Wired.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Furthermore, you're wrong about PayPal criticism not existing the sources you prefer.  Look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wilsonweb.com/wct5/paypal_assess.htm">well written criticism</a> from a magazine. You rejected a news website with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/46325.html">PayPal criticism</a> on the basis that it only talked about one customer's complaint about how the account was closed (btw, it was actually frozen)--a complaint from a major customer of a VERY POPULAR website (<a href="/wiki/Something_Awful" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There are a variety of news sources publishing the same story about Something Awful's account.  You have changed the rules now--it's not enough to get mentioned by many news sources and have the client itself be highly notable itself, the individual action taken must past crossmr's personal, non-wikipedia based standard? Sorry, but you aren't supported by any policies here, either.  At this point I can't assume good faith anymore, I can only assume that you're trying remove all criticism no matter what.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There's also plenty written patent lawsuits of PayPal in news sources.  This is not counting other types of lawsuits.  Even the legal section includes one of the lawsuits, but it's not listed as criticism.  The website <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/paypal7.htm">HowStuffWorks</a> (very popular) not only lists criticism, but considers PayPalSucks.com to be the most prominent website for criticism--there's it being mentioned in a reliable source.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Whether or not PayPalSucks.com is objective or truthful is irrelevant, as Wikipedia doesn't assess truth.  Where is the evidence that PayPalSucks.com is run by the merchantinc.com people?  Just because they recommend it doesn't mean that they're the same company and the burden is on you to prove that they are the same organization.  In other words, you need to prove that PayPalsucks.com is not an independent source.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>That is all from a cursory search, too.  How can you claim there is no notable criticism?  As for putting the foot down--this extends beyond just a single website, it's more than crossmr keeps trying to censor criticism and write his own policies.  I suggest  you read him repeatedly asserting that various things are policy without backing them up.  Remember, crossmr even tried to remove mention of <a href="/wiki/Something_Awful" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>'s account being frozen even though he acknowledged the link should be included.  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 09:31, 25 August 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>And your recent edit clearly shows the bias you're trying to insert. Nowhere in that article did I see a quote from the something awful individual stating he was criticizing them for freezing the account. In fact he clearly states that he understood why they did it, but didn't like the way the customer service handled it after it was frozen. We don't deal in sensationalism and we're not your soapbox. This <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wilsonweb.com/wct5/paypal_assess.htm">[1]</a> defends against criticism, it doesn't criticize. He takes common criticisms he found floating around the web and addressed them. His only conclusion? Once again a big company is having issues with its customer service. This is neither unique nor special to paypal. Its almost a given, and really would only be notable if their customer service was an exceptional level of bad or good.</dd>
<dd><blockquote><p>From where I stand, PayPal still needs to work on its inadequate customer service system. Paying customers have a right to expect better, more responsive, service.</p></blockquote></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>
But when I consider other complaints against PayPal, I find several of them ignorant or unrealistic in their expectations. 
</p><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>He's pretty clear on what he's saying there. The only thing he really finds to be a valid criticism is the customer service. Those other criticism which you think are so important to include aren't worth talking about. As far as the definition of self-published goes, those sites are the poster child. Someone paid a few bucks for hosting and gathered some disgruntled people together to bash a company. Welcome to the internet. They're a dime a dozen. Anyone can fire one up. Anyone can fabricate the posts (or bulk of them) and content on those sites. They are not reliable. they will never be reliable in the context of wikipedia. If you chose to believe them, thats your choice, but if you'd like to discuss why they're not considered reliable and why, you might want to start some discussions over at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 18:07, 25 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The sentence I reinserted never said that the complaint was over the account getting frozen, so please, please stop acting in bad faith.  Not just that, but you deleted it in its entirety, instead of simply changing it so something like "Something Awful complained about such and such."  In other words, you're whitewashing criticism deliberately.  You can call me biased, but you certainly can't claim I'm acting in bad faith.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You only attempted address TWO of my many complaints regarding the criticism section and both are incomplete and in bad faith (you outright ignored other sources that would be considered reliable even under your definintion), meaning that you're effectively ending your participation--so how can you claim that a tag is unwarranted?  Your "definition" of bad faith is incredibly vague and isn't based on any policy or guidelines at all--please give SPECIFIC citations if you believe otherwise (your history shows that you'll just like to the main page and say "oh it's somewhewhere in there, trust me).  How much is a "few bucks" and where is this finance report you have of all these websites showing how much they've spent?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The source you quote says only that /several/ of the other complaints are unfounded, not ALL of them.  Please read the the source.  Even then, you still want ONE sentence for all of the criticism.  Furthermore, read this: "But freezing PayPal accounts has raised the ire of many vocal critics."  That's an acknowledgement that it's a common complaint, not just a few people--meaning it warrants inclusion (it doesn't matter whether or not the source agrees) and still, you want one sentence no matter how many complaints there are.  The various lawsuits against PayPal? Nothing.  Various reliable websites you exclude for no reason?  The rest that you exclude on the basis of financial information you don't have and refuse to even define?  You are giving undue weight.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>When you're reading to address all of my NPOV/undue weight issues, go ahead, but until then all I have is you repeating the same one censoring edit and just being vague about how the rest must somehow be wrong without providing anything to support your argument.  And as such I am tagging this for NPOV issues, because you are outright refusing to address many them partially or entirely (not just disagreeing).</i> --<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 23:32, 27 August 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>You're being deliberately vague and non-specific about the complaint to make it look like it was more than it was. Again you've inserted information about the case which is immaterial to the complaint itself. Not once did he complain about the account being frozen, only how customer service handled it. The customer service has been criticized generally and not specifically. The other sources support that. Mentioning hurricane katrina when the complaint wasn't about that is sensationalism by trying to garner sympathy and put a pov on the issue by making it out to be bigger than it is. You haven't provided a reliable source for criticism of the closure of the accounts. The only reliable sources there debunks those complaints. You continue to insert information for which a reliable source has not been provided. <i>this manner of investigation has lead to criticism.</i> No, the guy from something awful said he understood why they did it, no criticism there. The other article which discusses "common criticisms" on the web, concludes that anything outside of the customer service complaints aren't worth discussing as far as he's concerned as his conclusion only focuses on those as being notable. <i>which caused the donations to be sent back to the donors, resulting in complaints regarding the handling of the case.</i> anyone who reads that without bothering to read the case could very easily conclude that paypal was criticized for freezing the accounts and not simply for their customer service. This is the NPOV issue. Again wikipedia is not your soapbox. The only thing that has been provided in reliable sources is criticism of their customer service. Not the vague "handling" of a case tied to a controversial subject. As far as my citation for anyone being able to create these sites? Why don't you head over to <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://powweb.com">[2]</a> and you too can create a paypal attack site for only $8/month to say whatever you want about paypal with whatever criteria you want. Plenty of storage and plenty of traffic to host one of these sites. There are 3 citations there for that criticism (though one of them isn't really a citation of criticism, because its not covered in the ecommerce link) if someone wants an example that is what the references are for. Adding an "example" while using a controversial hot topic is undue weight. As far as whitewashing it goes, I've pointed out that this complaint about customer service for a company so large that does so much volume is barely notable. Its a concession to even allow it to be mentioned in the article, reliable sources or not. one general criticism and an article from a couple of years ago doesn't build a very strong case that criticism of paypal is notable outside of some self-published gripe sites.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:54, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've provided two specific issues with what you wrote. One is a out right fabrication which isn't supported by the sources and the other is with the way its worded to leave possibly mislead the reader in to thinking the criticism was about more than just the customer service and possibly about the actual freezing of the accounts (which was in the fabrication). You're obviously trying to build a case that paypal has been criticized over the freezing of the accounts (and not just in their customer service after an account was frozen). If this is the case, find some news articles and provide it. In none of those articles do I read any valid criticism of paypal freezing accounts. The fact that you're struggling to find news articles and the like that criticize paypal and are continually trying to push for self-published sources to be included should clearly indicate to you that the criticism is not nearly as notable as those sites make it out to be. If it was you'd be able to find endless news articles written on the subject.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:18, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You're attempting wikilawyering and aren't doing a good job of it.  Again you still refuse to address my many NPOV issues stated and requests for you to cite various specific aspects of policies to actually support what I'm saying.  For example (just one example there are more), my queries about the Google Test which you never backed up--saying "oh it's part of policy somewhere on the reliable sources page kinda sorta maybe dunno" doesn't cut it. I've been very specific and if you thought otherwise, you should have ASKED which parts weren't specific enough instead of outright ignoring them to push your POV.  On the contrary, you have been deliberately vague and I still asked for clarification--you didn't.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I'm getting very sick of your lies.  Now that you're not getting your way, even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2005/09/68788">Wired.com</a> is not a reliable source, nor is the very website (SomethingAwful.com--very notable and has its own Wikipedia article).  Kyanaka (you know who that is, right?) called it a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/paypal-fiasco-summary.php">fiasco</a>.  This can all be found using a very straightforward and simple Google search, so your lies and bad faith don't cut it--this was also well known within various internet communities.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>If we had to your way, no article on all of Wikipedia about a company would have any criticisms about customer service AT ALL.  Apparently, major, news-worthy cases of customer service complaints don't even qualify.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>You don't delete something in its entirety if just part of it is inaccurate, you CORRECT IT.</i>  The statement NEVER said that they were complaining over the accounts being frozen, that is another one of your lies--I even changed it as a good faith measure to clarify that.  If you thought the phrasing was bad, then rephrase it--deleting it all is blatant POV pushing and whitewashing.  Even if mentioning Hurricane Katrina was not appropriate, then you would just delete the reference to Hurricane Katrina itself.  One of the major reasons that it was so controversial was the fact that it was for donations for Katrina--it's very relevant.  Whether or not you agree with that making it worse is irrelevant to the fact that many did. <i>If you disagree, go to <a href="/wiki/Something_Awful" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> and remove reference to it, I dare you.</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You are using your personal agenda to set Wikipedia policy--if a reliable source mentions something, it can be used, even if that source disagrees with it.  First, I'll mention that you said that page stated that there was only that one type of criticism an the rest were bogus, when he said "several" of the rest were bogus, not all--you refused to address that lie.  Second, the source said there are MANY complaints--"many" making it notable by NPOV standards--the author's personal standard of notability (if he even said that) is 100% irrelevant as we're dealing with Wikipedia notability standards.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>As for your "citation," it's not a citation for what I was asking for at all.  I never asked how to setup a website, but you can feel free to ramble about that to distract from the real point.  I asked for your citation in policies/guidelines regarding how much a website costs as a factor in determining it as a reliable source (it doesn't exist) and another citation providing the financial records for PayPalSucks.com--since you claim to know how much they've spent.  Furthermore, what about traditional news sources linking to paypal criticism websites?  They have done it and I seem to recall you explictily saying that qualifies it for external linking.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Lets not forget the many lawsuits against PayPal.  I'm sure that a lawsuit against a company, especially a class action lawsuit from customers with specific demands, hardly qualifies as a criticism, right?  I actually brought this up before and you ignored it. -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 03:25, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I can't believe I have to do this.  It is just so obvious that it's criticism and you're denying it and it really makes me wonder if you're a shill for PayPal.  I linked this page from <a href="/wiki/Something_Awful" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>'s talk page for input.  Here's a quote form Kyanaka: <i>"I'm not going to tell people to close their Paypal accounts. I'm not going to say all their actions were completely unwarranted. I'm just presenting my experience with them and will allow you to draw your own conclusions. However, I harbor a fundamental disagreement with their business practice of assuming all their clients are filthy criminals who must repeatedly prove their innocence to a series of unmanned servers and computer systems. I do not support their ability to freeze entire accounts, take money from whoever they want at whatever time they want, and impose whatever arbitrary rules and regulations they deem necessary without having to answer to any organization."</i>  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 03:40, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>did I deny it? no. I questioned it when compared to the other citations, I also pointed out that he makes a number of points in what he's saying where he doesn't criticize them or all of their behaviour. In one breath he criticizes them, in another breath he says he understands why they did certain things and doesn't blame them for it. Worse they're about the same thing. Here he criticizes them for the freezing of the account, yet tells wired he doesn't blame them for it. So which is it?--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:07, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Actually, you've denied that he's criticizing PayPal at all, why else would you remove any mention of him criticizing them for anything?  So what if he doesn't cricize 100% of their behavior?  Are you suggesting that it's not criticism if someone doesn't criticize 100% of it?  The only thing he doesn't blame them for is the red flagging, but feel free to quote something else.  Where does he contradict himself?  I want to see the precise quotes.  Even if you were true, at best it would mean an inconsistency over criticism of the act of freezing itself--he still clearly criticized other aspects, hence IT IS NOTABLE and should be INCLUDED.  Why do you keep removing the criticism in its entirety instead of clarifying and correcting it?  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 05:31, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You may wish to read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CIVIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPA">WP:NPA</a> before continuing. Did I say wired was unreliable? No. I said it was reliable. I also said it did not support what you claimed. The wired article very clearly states he is criticizing them for their customer service, NOT for the freezing of the account. You're trying to use the source to support something which he didn't criticize them for. He may have criticized them elsewhere, but no where in those 3 sources were they criticized for the actual freezing of the account. The core of what you wrote was inaccurate and a fabrication. There is no elaboration on the specific incident necessary to convey the point that paypal has been criticized for its customer service. A 2 year old article about an incident. Put that in perspective with how large a company paypal is and the volume they do and the best specific example (and seemingly only one) that is really newsworthy is 2 years old? How notable does the criticism of paypals customer service really look in that context? If you were finding a news article a month about it I'd say create a multiparagraph section dedicated to just that. But that's not the case here is it? Have you read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>? Did you read the section on undue weight? <i>Accounts which accrue funds quickly can be locked for investigation as to the source of the funds and this manner of investigation has lead to criticism.</i> There is no other way to read that than <i>people are criticizing them for freezing the accounts</i>. That isn't in those 3 sources. No where. I've read them each about 3 times. If you'd like to introduce more reliable sources feel free but they have to go in the article with the content. The only criticism that individual felt worthy of concluding the article with was about the customer service. Even if there were any he felt that might have had merit (he says several, but doesn't elaborate on which ones so its impossible to draw the conclusion on what if any other criticism he felt might be valid) was the customer service issue. The only conclusion the reader can draw is the same one he drew, the customer service is notable, several of the rest are false, and any remaining which aren't false aren't worth talking about. The ones he does conclude are notable enough to discuss and be concerned about are covered in the criticism section. The cost of the website has nothing to do with it. the fact is there is no evidence those website are run by professional journalists or anything of the like. Again go read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> under self-published sources which these are. They've either got to be professional researchers or journalists for self-published opinions to have any verifiability outside of about themselves. Lawsuits can be cited. If you can provide citation they can be put in the article. Hurricane katrina is meaningless. It has nothing to do with the complaint in the wired article. The complaint is about the customer service. The customer service issue came up around a controversial event, but other than that the two aren't linked. Paypal wasn't out beating survivors while they floated down the streets. they froze an account which accrued money very quickly, a new account. Even on the something awful link you provide, he admits that he doesn't blame paypal for raising red flags over that. So then it becomes a question of what happened? There are two sides to the story and you're all too willing to provide a single side. It could be pretty easy to solve though. is there a copy of the ToS from when the Something awful donation account was created? Did he simply fail to read the ToS and find that if his account behaved that way it'd be frozen? Don't know, and wouldn't know from those links. you have his self-published statement about what happened. Much like a newspaper editorial which I've seen some people discount because they're "opinion" pieces and not based on verifiable facts like a normal column article. The question then comes up why didn't wired report that he was criticizing them for freezing the account and not simple the customer service after the fact?--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:14, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I should add that I reported you for violating 3RR.  I'll number some of the current points (I'll get to the others after this) to make sure you address them.  I suggest you read all the pages you linked to yourself, as you don't seem to understand how they work and I assure, I often read them to make sure I'm following them.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>1.  The fact of the matter is, criticism of PayPal exists by SA, regardless of the specifics.  You are deleting the statement in its ENTIRETY instead of just correcting what it's about.  You quote one sentence, but you deleted TWO.  Sorry, but that's completely dishonest.  I've explicitly asked you to clarify it if you think the phrasing is bad after attempting to clarify it myself.  Deleting it instead of clarifying it is a clear violation of NPOV policy.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>2.  At the end of the sentence I added "and this manner of investigation has lead to criticism."  The reader could conclude that it was the manner of investigation that was being criticized, obviously.  If you were acting in good faith, you could have just changed it to your liking, such as "PayPal has been criticized for the method of investiagion used preceding accounts being frozen."</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>2.  I never said it was criticism over freezing the account.  You are changing the subject repeatedly and at best this equates to nitpicking semantics.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3.  A source from the horse's mouth is DEFINITELY reliable.  Something Awful not only is a notable website in and of itself, but the quotes from that page a from the site's FOUNDER--OFFICIAL STATEMENTS.  Official statements from a party involved in a notable incident are always notable, feel free to establish otherwise.  Feel free to cite any part of policy or guideline citing otherwise, so far you've only linked to general pages.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>4.  "The wired article very clearly states he is criticizing them for their customer service, NOT for the freezing of the account."  So why try to prevent that from being in the article?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>5.  Regarding the criticism article.  He said that there are many criticisms about accounts being frozen.  Many criticisms = notable.  "But freezing PayPal accounts has raised the ire of many vocal critics."  Whether or not he thinks these criticisms are valid or notable are totally irrelevant.  If many opinions exist about something, they MUST be included in the article regardlesss of their veracity.  This is the core of NPOV policy.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>6.  The author's notability and Wikipedia's notability are two different things.  Whether or not he considers something notable is irrelevant.  All that matters is acknowledgment that something is frequent enough.  Something being common enough inherently makes it notable.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>7.  "any remaining which aren't false aren't worth talking about"  You are speculating about his thoughts--Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.  It is possible that he did not want to write about them for various reasons.  Following your logic, an author will always include 100% of all information available on the subject they're writing about that they consider notable.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>8.  "There is no elaboration on the specific incident necessary to convey the point that paypal has been criticized for its customer service."  So Wikipedia should never give examples?  I want to see this anti-example policy.  Examples certainly help convey a point better and help to better ground it in reality rather than this "Wikipedia must be vague and general" policy you created.  The event happened with a notable website using services from a notable service that got published in various news sources.  Surely, that's not notable.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>9.  "A 2 year old article about an incident."  Wikipedia records history.  The age of the incident is irrelevant.  So historical criticisms of a company should never be excluded?  Wikipedia is not paper.  Talk about whitewashing history. "Put that in perspective with how large a company paypal is and the volume they do and the best specific example (and seemingly only one) that is really newsworthy is 2 years old?"  Volume?  That sounds like original research to me.  It's not the only event, there are a variety of other lawsuits on concerning different issues.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>10.  "If you were finding a news article a month about it I'd say create a multiparagraph section dedicated to just that."  How would being recent make it warrant multiple paragraphs?  Does this mean that such a criticism would be deleted 2 years later?  Again, Wikipedia is not paper.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>11. "Again go read WP:RS and WP:V under self-published sources which these are."  This is why I asked you to be specific.  Why are you refusing to be specific?  I asked this because a) they are not that specific and b) there are different parts of them.  Can you quote something or reference a part of it that is relevant?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I've reread those and don't see any of the sources used qualifying as self-published.  PayPalSucks.com is hardly a personal website and is definitely not a blog.  Even with blogs it is meant to only apply to certain types (read the citation).  There are also exceptions to self-published works at that.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>12. "The only criticism that individual felt worthy of concluding the article with was about the customer service."  You acknowledge this and yet you want to delete one of the most well cited (non-legal-action) examples of this.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>13-a. "They've either got to be professional researchers or journalists for self-published opinions to have any verifiability outside of about themselves."  Interestingly, this isn't a part of Wikipedia policy.  Feel free to cite a specific section or even better quote from part of it if you feel otherwise.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>13-b. "The cost of the website has nothing to do with it."  Then Don't say it does!  You're backpedaling.  It seems that you make up the rules as you go, then back out of them when it's demonstrated that they can't work.  So please, either point to specific parts of a policy that backs up what you say, or at least try to give a specific definition of a self-reported source that you won't back out of. -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 07:51, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>14. "Lawsuits can be cited.  If you can provide citation they can be put in the article."   They have been.  The class-action lawsuit has been in the article for a very long time, just not listed under the criticism section.  I also added about half a dozen more lawsuits.  So why are you still refusing to acknowledge that there is verifiable and notable criticism of this form?  Is Wikipedia supposed to be as vague as possible?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>15.  "The customer service issue came up around a controversial event, but other than that the two aren't linked."  Since you are intent on analyzing how they're linked.  Without that controversial event, the customer service issue would NOT EXIST.  Without Hurricane Katrina, this would have never happened, because obviously they're not creating a charity for an event that didn't happen.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You don't understand how notability applies.  When it comes to criticism, notability is measured by the amount of criticism that exists and nothing else--the veracity (truth) of it is irrelevant as Wikipedia doesn't include material on the basis of accuracy.  The reason this was so controversial (with so much public outcry) was because it was such a large amount donated by so many people on the account of a notable Website for something they considered a serious worthy cause.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>All of the articles on it bring up Katrina, which in itself makes it relevant in the article.  That would be ridiculous--Wikipedia's goal is not to be vague, especially considering it's in all the linked articles anyway.  Are you going ask to exclude it mentioning that it involved SA too?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>16.  "There are two sides to the story and you're all too willing to provide a single side."  LOL.  That's a good one.  You're all too willing to delete that side and you're accusing me of bias.  I am not against showing the other side at all, feel free to point where I deleted things you've added showing the other side--OH WAIT--you never even attempted to do that, making your criticism disingenuous.  In fact, almost all of the article is either neutral or in favor of PayPal anyway.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>17.  "It could be pretty easy to solve though. is there a copy of the ToS from when the Something awful donation account was created? Did he simply fail to read the ToS and find that if his account behaved that way it'd be frozen?"  Read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOR">WP:NOR</a>--that's blatant original research, not to mention would involve using your personal POV about what he did or did not fail to do.  You haven't even given any sources for this and yet you claim it's so easy to solve.  Go ahead--be honest and do this easy thing. -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 07:51, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>18.  In addition to my commentary on your misinterpretation of it, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> is a guideline, NOT a policy.  I strongly suggest you read up on the differences between policies and guidelines.  One of the main reasons for this is that it requires inherent value judgments of the veracity and objectivity of the content, which is against the general spirit of NPOV policy.  This prevents people from excluding websites via wikilawyering and arguing semantics  (to promote a POV) which are clearly useful for the encyclopedia and will increase its quality.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Assuming we used your incorrect interpretation of the guideline, we would basically have to exclude all high quality writing, no matter how well-written and well sourced if the person wasn't a paid writer.  There is absolutely no policy on Wikipedia that prohibits usage of blogs.  You should keep this in mind when you edit other articles as well.  Please stop suggesting that your personal opinion is Wikipedia policy--there's a reason that you are unable to cite anything specific to back up your statements--it's because nothing exists.  For someone so obsessive about citations, you sure seem to do a poor job of it yourself.  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 08:20, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>1. The specifics are quite important. You're ignoring the fact that he told wired that he didn't blame them for freezing the account and then wrote on SA that he does blame them. We don't blindly cite things in the face of contradictory evidence.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>2. When I pointed out the problem with the sentence, if you were acting in good faith you would have changed the way it was worded. You wanted the material included its up to you to make sure its acceptable. I pointed out on the talk page and in the edit summary the problem. Instead of fixing it you reverted it ignoring the problems.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>3. Primary sources are not the preferred method of citation on wikipedia. Notability has NOTHING to do with verifiability they are two completely different things.From <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> <i>Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.</i>. Something awful doesn't fall under that. However wired does and it contradicts what he says on SA.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>4. I didn't prevent it. What you included was an attempt to be vague about the issue and make it look like it was more than it was. You tried to use a hot button controversial topic to create a neutrality issue.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>5. Keep reading NPOV, especially undue weight. If you can't find any news stories about people actually criticizing them for freezing accounts, no. He says there are many complaints about many things, but concludes that only the ones about customer service are worth really talking about and that is what is in the article.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>6. He's a single author who has mentioned the frozen accounts yet concludes his article without mentioning them as an issue. That doesn't drive the notability of the problem up there.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>7. and you're speculating on any of the remaining ones which he MIGHT have thought were notable. We know he mentioned the customer service issues so he considers those notable. He didn't mention anything else. So anything else was either not notable to him or outright false.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>8. Some things need examples, some don't.  It would be a unique individual who came to this article that couldn't understand the concept that a large company has a customer service problem and what a customer service problem might be.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>9. Not at all. Historical criticism shouldn't be excluded, however it has to be in context. Again undue weight. If there was newsworthy criticism monthly I'd say dedicate all kinds of space to it. But that is not the case. You have 1 incident from 2 years ago.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>10. 1 article a month means 12 articles a year. Which means its an on-going and prominent issue worthy of extensive coverage in the article. Just because a company was criticized at one point or another (Which pretty much all companies are) doesn't mean its necessarily worth full extensive coverage in the article. Paypal certainly isn't wal-mart which his a mountain of news articles written about the criticism of that company.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>11. Paypal sucks or any of  those other cites are not field experts. I've pointed out how easy it is to whip up one of those sites. I also told if you wanted to discuss their reliability there are two talk pages perfect for it.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>12. No I wanted to prevent that example from being use as a soapbox with sensationalist language. You've made 3 points on this so far, all saying the same thing and each time missing the point.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>13-a they've changed the policy since I last read read it but it still requires them to be recognized experts in the field which these are not.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>13-b No I'm not. I was simply explaining the ease with which one of these sites can be whipped up and why they're not considered reliable. You can spend all the time you like on RS and V finding out why if you like. You also fail to note that two other individuals came here on your request for comment and also stated they didn't think the site should be linked to. In wikipedia thats known as consensus.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>14 anyone can file a lawsuit. I could file one right now. That doesn't necessarily make my point of view notable.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>15. without his parents conceiving him this wouldn't exist either. Should we talk about birth control or procreation?</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>16. if you have a problem with the article being neutral you should probably stop editing it right now.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>17. It can be original research if it was included in the article and presented as such. However its really unnecessary since the SA page isn't a third party report and the only third party report on it states he understands why they did it.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>18. I'm aware of the difference. But WP:V also has the section on self-published sources. I've also pointed you to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CIVIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and I suggest  you read them again before any further editing. Perhaps you should read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> again as well particular this section: <i>Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.[5]</i> It then clarifies when these are acceptable for use both in footnote and a further paragraph. <i>Self-published material may, in some circumstances, be acceptable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications. </i> and <i>Blogs" in this context refers to personal and group blogs. See e.g., Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Game_(game)_(6th_nomination) for an often-cited example deletion discussion covering this matter. Some newspapers host interactive columns that they call blogs, and these may be acceptable as sources so long as the writers are professionals and the blog is subject to the newspaper's full editorial control. Where a news organization publishes the opinions of a professional but claims no responsibility for the opinions, the writer of the cited piece should be phrasally attributed (e.g. "Jane Smith has suggested..."). Posts left on these columns by readers may never be used as sources</i> This very clearly spells out two very limited times in which "blogs" can be used. This is not the case here. And in case you missed it, WP:V is policy.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 14:39, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>1.  This is like pulling teeth.  Point out the contradiction.  Furthermore, are you seriously denying that he criticized PayPal and that tHe Wired article indicated that he criticized it?  '<i>You ignored the issue, AGAIN.  Why delete it instead of correct it? Answer if you want anyone to assume good faith?</i>   I never once said he criticized them for freezing; from the beginning, my entire point was that it was a criticism valid for inclusion.  This is the reason why I modified it to address your complaint.  After I modified it, you again deleted it in its entirety.  That's blatant POV pushing and whitewashing.  If you believed it simply was inaccurate on the sepcifics, then you would have modified that insetad of deleting it.
</p><p>2.  <b>I did change the way it was written as an attempt at compromise.  You rejected it and deleted its entirety instead of modifying it.</b>  Are you going to lie and rewrite history now?  I seriously expect an apology.  Then after deleting it instead of correcting it, I told you to simply modify it the way you wanted to because all you did was repeat yourself.  Since you were adding nothing new AFTER I attempted to modify it to your liking, I can't be psychic to know the precise phrasing you want.
</p><p>3.  They ARE preferred when you want to either a) get a direct quotation and/or b) express the view of a specific person or group.  Third party to Wikipedia, not the thing in question.  You're taking things said in GUIDELINES like "usually this is the case," then you blindly apply it like the law as if it applies in all cases.  You're taking that statement completely out of context.  By that logic, the U.S. Constitution shouldn't be referenced on articles of a constitutional matter, because it's a primary source.  That is most definitely not meant to apply to trying to accurately represent a specific person's view--for something like that you try to quote a primary source.  Y
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>ou know what Wired did?  They got their information from the same person who wrote that page--a primary source.  So again by your lgoic, we shouldn't trust Wired because they got their information from Kyanka.  Let me ask you a simple question: which do you think is a better source to use when trying to figure out and/or represnt's someone's view: a) secondary source with a few quotes, or b) a primary source containing a very long quotation.  And we can even include both!  BTW, many of the policies overlap.  Verfiability generally utilizes notable sources as reliable sources.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>4.  You violating te 3RR rule to prevent inclusion of a major example is prevention.  I was vague by trying to include a very specific example that you were trying to exclude?
</p><p>5.  The source in question IS a news source, it's just not a well known one.  No part of any policy requires that sources must only be news stories about that specific thing.  The fact remains, a source which qualifies as reliable acknowledges many people hold a view.  Specific cite proving otherwise.
</p><p>6-7.  No, I relied on him using the word "many."  "Many" people holding a view makes that view Wikipedia-notable.  I'm relying on a direct quotation from him, you're relying on speculation that he excluded something for one reason when there are other plausible reasons.  Again, you're still confusing his personal idea of notability with Wikipedias.  Since when does Wikipedia care whether or not a random person considers something notable by their own personal definition?  I pointed out how your <a href="/wiki/False_dichotomy" class="mw-redirect" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a> was flawed and you didn't actually address it, you just repeated yourself  I refer back to my original #7 so you can defend your logical error.
</p><p>8.  Do you really believe that or are you saying that in bad faith?  Your logic is horribly flawed--by that logic, no criticism of corporations should ever be in an article because people know what corporate criticism might be like.  Your argument is essentially "Wikipedia should be as vague as possible as long as a user can imagine various possibilities which may or may not correspond with what happened." Or imagine this "other electronic payment companies exist, so why do we need to explain any more than that it's an electronic payment company"?  The fact of the matter is that people aren't psychic and there are many different types of critciims a company might receive.  Given how new services like PayPal are, it makes these types of criticism more unique.  <b>Please point to any policy or guideliness requiring criticism to be unique to a specific company.'</b>
</p><p>9.  You still haven't explained what difference it makes if it was 2 years ago look up <a href="/w/index.php?title=Argumentum_ad_naseam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Argumentum ad naseam (page does not exist)">argumentum ad naseam</a>). This WAS in the news.  What do you call Wired?  What about the class-acion lawsuit that was in many major print newspapers?  OH yeah, I forgot that class-actions involve small numbers of people and no criticism.
</p><p>11.  There's no requirement for all cites to be from "field experts," and you have cited nothing indicating that.  You are equating creating a new website with nothing on it to a website that's been around years, is much more expensive to host (due to traffic), with plenty of gathered content on the issue, forums with many users expressing their views and is very popular for its subject matter.  If you think this should be diverted to antoher talk page so much, then do it yourself.  I suspect that you'll ignore this difference.
</p><p>12.  Now that's just plain disingenuous.  I tried inserting a single extra sentence and now that equates to "full, extensive news coverage"
</p><p>13-a.  Then cite some _SPECIFIC_ part of policy already and don't just claim "oh it supports me, take my word."
</p><p>13-b.  I asked you to define a self-published site and you responded specifically by saying the amount of money was a determining factor.  You can't even seem to admit it when I've caught you backpedaling.  Sorry, but you have no idea of the hosting costs of PayPalSucks.com and given its popularity, it's not likely to be cheap.  With Google Adsense alone, you could make at least hundreds, if not thousands per month on a site like that--so go ahead, make a site as popular as that, that manages to be popular within its category.
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I'll note that if you were obeying consensus, you wouldn't have repeatedly removed the sentence that different people were inserting.  It wasn't until you violated 3RR that you attempted any sort of compromise.  By the way, consensus doesn't work like that--2 random people dropping in, each with a single, brief comment, and not really providing Wikipedia policy/guideline based reasoning isn't consensus.  Consensus REQUIRES discussion--they just dropped in a random remark of their opinion.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>14.  You are being dishonest again.  Instead of acknowledging that there are notable lawsuits (which would mean multiple, notable criticisms)--you get on the defensive and try to imply that none of them are.  First you act as if the lawsuits haven't been cited, now you're claiming that they're not notable.  Sorry, but not just anyone can file a lawsuit and have it stick--if a random person came in and filed one it would have it readily dismiss.  We're talking about a class action lawsuit, along with patent and other lawsuits, several of which involved settlements.  The class-action one especially was published in various major newspapers.  So are none of those nontable? 
</p><p>15.  Give me a break.  That is so far indirect and so far in the past.  Hurrcaine Katrina was the DIRECT cause for creation of the PayPal donation account.
</p><p>16.  "if you have a problem with the article being neutral you should probably stop editing it right now."  Cute, you not only refused to address what I said in #16, you used a personal attack in place of anything subsantive.  You claim there should be another side shown, but you've made ZERO effort to ciing any sources or writing anything to show that side (because none exists that wouldn't be a violation of Wikikpedia rules).  Furthermore, I have done NOTHING to hinder it.
</p><p>17.  So you're acknowledging it would be original research...so why did you bring it up before if it couldn't be included on Wikipedia?  Are you just unable to admit you erred?  Where's this ban on primary sources, again?  You should go edit all the constitution articles to remove the constitution as a source! Sorry, but nowhere does Kyanka say that he understands all of their actions.  The only thing that he says he agrees with is the red flagging/freezing of the account itself.  Even in the Wired article its clear that he's criticizing how they handled it.
</p><p>18.  You should obey WP:CIVIL yourself if you're going to suggest that.  I read that section onf WP:V and even referenced it directly in my prior response, did you not read what I said?  What part of that even applies to PayPalSucks.com?  It doesn't attempt to even define what a self-published source is beyond personal websites and blogs (and at that it's vague).  This is why I asked for a specific definition from you and all you've done is make an assumption regarding PayPalSucks.com's hosting costs,which you don't know and given their popularity, is not safe to assume it's near even $20/month.  I'll note that section isn't supposed to be there anyway, since WP:RS is meant to define reliable sources, not WP:V (there's actually a recent discussion on exactly that on the talk page).  You should read more carefully, it doesn't offer that as if that is the only conceivable exception.  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 06:09, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

= I have a suggestion, everyone that for some reason have a urge to add an attack page to this article because the frozen account issues, why don't just add a section where you show the readers the paypal legal agreement regarding the limitation of the accounts and let the reader use their brains on it. paypalsucks.com is an attack page. But if you quote paypal user agreement, that seems fair to me and let the reader choose what is fair and what isn't. I don't see this problem with other articles about insurance company that as well they are unfair and people have no choice by law to have them. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ntt_ng&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ntt ng (page does not exist)">Ntt ng</a> 03:37, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

<p>I re-added this section because it both allows for reader convenience of being able to have all criticism consolidated together and to expand on the specific criticisms in the legal disputes which can be combined with non-legal ones.  There's nothing inherently wrong with being up the same thing in two sections, especialhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:PayPal&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29
Editing Talk:PayPal (section) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedialy if it's being combined with other things covering a different aspect.  Plus it wouldn't make sense to have a criticism section that doesn't so much as reference major lawsuits.  It would seem that you're engaging in a hyper-conservative literary approach as an excuse to remove as much criticism as possible--everything involving criticism must be consolidated into the vaguest summary possible, but this doesn't apply to anything else
</p><p>You started all this off by saying it was generous to have a single sentence for criticism and at that, I had to pull teeth to get it to say something other than "there have been complaints about their customer service."  It is about time that you admit that there have been major, notable critcisms.

<dl><dd>If you want to consolidate all criticism then remove the other legal issues section. We don't duplicate content within articles other than a brief summary as part of the introduction. You said you didn't want to ignore consensus, this is the consensus reached on the notability of things on the web: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WEB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Nowhere in there is the google test.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The focus of them is different.  One is about the criticism itself and the other is about the legal issues surrounding it.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Nowhere in there is the Google test or any related tests prohibited.  That's simply not how Wikipedia works "it's automatically prohibited unless a policy page says that it's allowed."  So I see that consensus doesn't support you at all and that on the contrary, it does allow me to do what I want.  Ironically, it even links to the Wikipedia search engine test page and even an essay saying that WP:WEB is too strict, in addition to the direct acknowledgment that occasional exceptions are ok (even if it were prohibited).  Please try to act in good faith--you repeatedly link to things that don't at all say what you claim they say.  -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

I can play that game--going by what the sub-guideline actually says--<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WEB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a NOTABILITY, not a reliability/verifiability guideline, and as such is for the purpose of inclusion of an article about a website, not using a website as a source.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I can also disprove your argument via other means (read <a href="/w/index.php?title=Negation_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Negation theory (page does not exist)">Negation theory</a>).   I was a part of those debates--consensus wasn't formed that it was unreliable, rather, there was a lack of consensus concerning its reliability so it wasn't included. You should probably take the linking of the search engine test and even an essay on WEB being too strict as a hint that there is a strong contingent of support, even if consensus wasn't formed.  That doesn't mean it's prohibited and it never has, otherwise Wikipedians would be completely and utterly unable to form anything new, from writing styles to organizational methods, without first creating a new policy/guideline for it.  Can you please show me the policy on Wikipedia showing that something is not allowed unless a gudieline or policy explicitly allows it?  Because that seems quite contrary to the whole spirit of Wikipedia.  Again, read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.  Local consensus on article pages is FREQUENTLY used, especially when there is an issue over interpretation of rules and/or application of an exception so even if things were forbidden by default, the guidelines allowing for exception allows this.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>For future reference, don't keep claiming things are policy if you aren't willing to back it up.  You say "it's policy, so I'm right," the burden of proof is on you.  Furthermore, trying to decide everything based on your own circular defintions and hyper literal, personalized interpretation of the letter of policy (via a default prohibition mentality) is not only against Wikipedia policy, but it is onyl incredibly counter-productive in terms of writing an encyclopedia, because it creates a type of <a href="/wiki/Thought-terminating_cliche" class="mw-redirect" title="Thought-terminating cliche">thought-terminating cliche</a> whereby you can't actually justify something on its own merits (which is required for consensus), you just defer to "it's in the rules somewhere." -<a href="/wiki/User:Njyoder" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 03:01, 2 September 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Its quite simple. When consensus is reached to expand policy to cover additional things, it gets added to the policy page. If someone is trying to make a case to use a kind of source, or write an article a kind of way and they succeed, that new consensus finds its way in to the policy or guideline. Especially in regards to something like WP:V and WP:RS. They're constantly contested because people want to try and get around them to say all kinds of things in all kinds of articles. So yes, there is lots of good faithed reasons to believe that if its not in WP:V or WP:RS there is no consensus for that particular type of source, etc. If you can demonstrate the consensus please do so.  The burden is also on you to present evidence supporting the inclusion. For example, provide debates on other article talk pages where sites of similar stature were debated and a consensus for their inclusion was reached. You don't get an automatic bye on presenting evidence because you went first. You haven't shown me anything that demonstrates this sites are remotely reliable other than your own word and calling them "inherently verifiable".--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:53, 2 September 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Wow, can you have a single response where you don't ignore a main point?  Let's reiterate, shall we?  It's a guideline (not policy) on notability, not reliability.  Even at that, it is for inclusion of an article on a website, not simply notability of a website for inclusion as a source.  The requirements of the latter are less.  You need to make up your mind, in the past you suggested that notability and reliability didn't overlap like this, now they do.  Please specify your true stance. Guidelines are descriptive, not prescriptive (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>).  Now you are suggesting that they're prescriptive and that if it doesn't list something, it is by default prohibited.  Again, I have to repeat myself because you ignored this--even this NOTABILITY guideline links to the search test and I have seen lots of support for it when I was involved in the formation of WP:WEB.  You're dealing with a sub-guideline concerning a different subject, so to suggest that this is prescriptive and requires an large consensus in favor of this method to use it _AT ALL_ in any articles is ludicrous, especially considering it has built in exceptions and...links to the search test page.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You seem to want to shift the burden of everything off yourself--when it's repeatedly established that you're making false claims regarding what policy is.  It seems you want me to carry the brunt of the work whenever you are the one making the positive claim--"this is policy," and yet, you've failed to prove that.  And again, another thing you still ignored is the built in exceptions, which by definition means that it is not a default prohibition--in other words, all that is needed is a local consensus.  Go read <a href="/wiki/IntelliTXT" title="IntelliTXT">IntelliTXT</a>.  Note that it includes criticism from *gasp* a blogger.  But why was it included?  Because he authors one of the most popular blogs (i.e. a highly notable blog), which makes his views on advertising in blogs notable.  I bet you'll race over there to change it to convince yourself that it somehow makes you right, even though you're going against consensus for that page and the obvious that that a top blogger might just have a notable opinion on blogs.  You never bother finding supporting evidence of precedent or consensus in articles supporting any of your points, even though you've stated mulitple times now that various guidelines/policies supported you, but I was generous enough to find it for you even though it wasn't necessary.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

A few trivial mentions doesn't make the site notable, not that that would have a bearing on its reliability.

Your point about the numbers was that you didn't mean what you actually said (that a precentage is needed)? The number of users does help demonstrate that it's a non-trivial viewpoint, genius. Nice backpedal.  I'll add that to the list of other times that you've backpedaled and changed what you said (for example, Kyanka wasn't criticzing anything, that no notable criticism existed outside of his [even though the legal seciotion had existed forever]).

I'll point out more bad faith: you took the word "may" to mean "must."  "May" simply means you're authorized to do it, not that it's a good idea to automatically do it (doing it blindly without thinking about it).  You give editors a reasonable amount of time to find a source-leaving it in encourages others to help find it too because they see it tagged as such, plus you don't have to require them to keep a special talk page copy of it.  You had no point about the number of users except to say "nyah nyah they don't count get me a scientific opinion poll."  That's a large forum, which makes it far, far from just some random site a user put up overnight--and yet, you're continuing to use an argument based on it being that.

I'm not suggesting relying on random user postings, I'm suggesting using the forum as a whole to gauge the notability of the website PayPalSucks.com--I'm not quoting from it.

<p>Yes and I responded to that.  If you're willing to debate it, instead of just repeat your viewpoint, then go ahead.   I'm waiting for your counter-argument to my last response.  Independent fact checking isn't a requirement for anything, otherwise the fact checking for newspapers would become invalid, because newspapers check their own facts.

<dl><dd>the paypal article page is not the place to discuss the general behaviour of why some people tag articles, why some remove right away, why some do both, etc. You've already been cited the text from the relevant policy if you want to discuss its merits feel free to do so on its talk page.--<a href="/wiki/User:Crossmr" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:30, 6 September 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Just ran across this dispute during my biweekly review of the mess at Requests for arbitration.  As an experienced Wikipedia editor (who shot the photo for this article, by the way), I concur with Crossmr's position and oppose Njyoder's position.  Njyoder has demonstrated a pattern of reliance on unreliable sources to support highly controversial assertions (whose controversial nature requires them to be cited to highly reliable and verifiable sources). For an example of a properly researched article based on reliable and verifiable sources, see my work at <a href="/wiki/Lawyer" title="Lawyer">Lawyer</a>.  --<a href="/wiki/User:Coolcaesar" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 05:42, 6 September 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Coolcaesar, you're posting in the wrong section.  I also suggest that you read through the talk pages instead of just relying on crossmr's biased representation on the arbitration page.  Just as an example, he tried lying about me violating 3RR, while downplaying him doing it himself.  If you want to understand crossmr's viewpoint, this all started by crossmr trying to argue that no criticism should be included _at all_ and that one sentence was generous.  It's more complex than he makes it seem, hence you need to read all of the talk page.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Crossmr, that's just an excuse to not defend a viewpoint that you have realized you are unable to defend, but want to continue utilizing nonetheless.  There is no official policy or guideline on tagging methods/etiquette, because it's a de facto standard, not a de jure standard.  All you've stated is that "this is how I do it," which is counter-productive and counter-consensus.  Do you really think it's proper Wikipedia etiquette to refuse to even discuss standards of how to deal with the articles that you're editing on?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You have done absolutely nothing to defend the practice of tagging and removing immediately afterward, because it makes no sense.  Removing it without tagging would at least make some sense, even if it were bad practice.  Tags exist to alert people that information exists which needs citation and does so two ways: a notice in the article itself and by adding it to a category of uncited articles.  By removing the tag right after placing it, you're removing its only two methods of serving its purpose, thereby defeating the purpose.  Can you concede this?  If you can, I can move on to why things should be left in the article for a while instead of removing without tagging.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Also, I've tried copying things to other pages before (like with the RS talk page) and you came in and dishonestly just repeated your original viewpoints multiple times (which everyone already knew), without debating (i.e. defending the merits of your viewpoints) anything.

<p>Here you go doing it again.  Is libel a habit of yours?  Stop it.  Contrary to your latest claim, I did NOT say they weren't headquartered in San Jose.  And you're saying a deletion was insertion of original research.  What utter hogwash.  "it's the high-paid executives in San Jose who pull the strings and control the money" appears to be original research.  While ebay's CxOs are probably not in Omaha, what beyond that do you have evidence of, re. PayPal?  You want to put back a picture that misleadingly suggests the company operates primarily out of N First street, fine.  I give up; pollute away.  Caught you in another lie.

The very selection and omission of external links is far from NPOV.  All in-article criticism except for one anecdotal (and relatively well-resolved) case has been removed.  "Newspaper articles have reported that disgruntled customers who have been unable to contact anyone at PayPal to resolve their disputes have created their own website providing consumers with difficult-to-find customer service numbers and reporting their own frustrations with PayPal's service.

You did insert a maintenance tag, but at the same time deleted the large block of text in question, thereby reverting another's edit.  I just looked at the definition and found "An edit war occurs when contributors, or groups of contributors, repeatedly revert each other's contributions." I can't apologize for or retract what still appears to me to be a valid accusation, but you might want to consider taking such actions.  I see you claim the content you removed is linkspam.  We can respectfully disagree on these points, I hope - AGF and all.   If I have reason to believe you were unaware of the edit war, and recognize that you marked a far-from-minor edit as minor, then I will reconsider my edit war accusation.

The text removal concurrent with the tag addition was accidental and for that I apologize, it is plainly evident to anyone who bothered to look at the page history that I am in no way involved in an <i>edit war</i> on this article.  I will point out that the qualifier "repeatedly" is an integral part of your quoted definition of <i>edit war</i> and as I only have 2 edits to this article, 1 two weeks ago and another 6 months ago, I in now way qualify as <i>edit warring</i> on this article and have (again) stricken my name from your little <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPA">attack list</a>.

<dl><dd>It is plainly evident to anyone who bothered to look at the page history that you were involved in an <i>edit war</i> on this article; it shows that you deleted a block of text that has been added and deleted several times in rapid succession as part of an edit war over that block of text; that doesn't mean I think you are a bad person, or need censure or am attacking you.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> is specifically not applicable to citation/reference links.

<dd>Just to point out: the edit warring of adding inadequately sourced content was done by <strong class="error"><a href="/wiki/Template:User-multi" title="Template:User-multi">User-multi</a> error: no username detected (<a href="/wiki/Template:User-multi#No_username_detected" title="Template:User-multi">help</a>).</strong> <s>and <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:76.99.249.6&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:76.99.249.6 (page does not exist)">76.99.249.6</a>&#160;(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:76.99.249.6" title="User talk:76.99.249.6">talk</a>&#160;<b>·</b> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/76.99.249.6" title="Special:Contributions/76.99.249.6">contribs</a>).  I noticed those were conspicuously absent from your section name on this thread</s>.  You also claim that the criticism section was removed wholesale; which was not the case - only the poorly sourced additions to it were reverted.  I, and the multiple other editors who removed the content, appear to have all left the initially existing content.</dd>
<dd>As I said in the thread above this one - I have no problem with a criticism section, and I agree that it needs to be expanded.  However, proper <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">sources</a> need to be used - which has not been done thus far.  Here's the summary I see from an edit <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PayPal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=266928002">which I reverted</a>:</dd>
<dd>Item 1 used the "aboutpaypal.org" site which is little more than a publicly open blog that also acts as a front-end (almost an advert) to a competitor product.</dd>
<dd>Item 2 used paypaldeveloper.com/pdn/board/, which is a forum/message board - again, clearly not a reliable source.</dd>
<dd>Item 3 used dnforum.com/f77/, which is another forum/message board.</dd>
<dd>Item 4 used a wikipedia link as a ref ... the original poster may have meant a different link, but it's impossible to tell.</dd>
<dd>Item 5 used another aboutpaypal.org link - see issue on item 1.</dd>
<dd>Item 6 used paypalsucks.com, the specific link being an article written by copy/paste text from a forum/message board.</dd>
<dd>I hadn't seen the other item you located that had been removed in November ... that was removed prior to my paying much attention to this article.  It does use a RS, so should be possible to re-add to the article - although the wording should be improved to make clear it was a past issue (unless another current source can be found to confirm if the problem still exists - I'm not sure myself).  --- <a href="/wiki/User:Barek" title="User:Barek">Barek</a> <small>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Barek" title="User talk:Barek">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barek" title="Special:Contributions/Barek">contribs</a>)</small> - 16:54, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sorry about that - I misread what you had posted on the wholesale removal of new text v entire section.  Although, due to the lack of reliable sources, I don't see any alternatives without new sources being provided (with the exception of the removal from November, as I mentioned above ... that one appears to have been a reliable source).</dd>
<dd>As to item 1 ... the paypal.com link is to PayPal's user agreement page.

<p>The section on the security key is self-contradictory.

But then a couple of sentences later, the article says the security key is not required; the credit card number can be used instead.  That's a helpful convenience, but it's no longer two-factor authentication. The credit card number is the same type of factor as the password -- something known.  (Furthermore, it's not even a secret if it's ever been used to buy something.)

<p>The PayPal acceptable use policy has a series of boilerplate terms <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?&amp;cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/AcceptableUse_popup">[18]</a> against "using the PayPal service for activities that ... relate to sales of items that "2 relate to sales of ... (c) items that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity, (d) items that promote hate, violence, racial intolerance, or the financial exploitation of a crime, (e) items that are considered obscene, (f) items that infringe or violate any copyright, trademark, right of publicity or privacy or any other proprietary right under the laws of any jurisdiction ..."

</p><p>Its what you sell.. not what you buy.  Thats mainly because visa and mastercard require you to pay a $750/yr or so last time I checked (with only a 1% chargeback threshold before massive fines start piling up) fee to be a "high risk" (read porn site) merchant. and american express allows no porn sites at all on thier network I forget about discover.. but who has a discover card anyway,,.  so rather then break up what cards some accounts may take and risk huge fines they just banned porn completly to keep all paypal accounts uniform.  sad if you ask me.  if its legal.. you should be able to sell it.  The govt tried to ban it.. but couldn't so got visa and mastercard to make it very difficult in exchange for bankruptcy reform. -<a href="/wiki/User:Tracer9999" title="User:Tracer9999">Tracer9999</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tracer9999" title="User talk:Tracer9999">talk</a>) 17:23, 6 June 2010 (UTC)
