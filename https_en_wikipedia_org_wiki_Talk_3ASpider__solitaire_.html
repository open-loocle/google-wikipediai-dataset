<p>The bit that says the chance of winning is only about 1-in-10 needs to be clarified. R.J.Lintemuththe author of the page this bit of data was culled from was referring to four suit Spider Solitaire.  On "Medium" Difficulty in the Windows XP version, however, there are only two suits, and - while it may not be representative - I have a better than 80% win rate after quite a few games.  So either I have improbably hit only the winnable games, or the "medium" (two suit) difficulty has a much higher winnability.  Either way, this section needs clarification.
</p>
<dl><dd>Naturally "medium" difficulty has a higher winnability than "difficult". <a href="/wiki/User:JudahH" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 21:54, 18 July 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>"Winnability" is certainly determined by the version of Spider that you play. My experience with XP version is about a 60% win rate on difficult (about 1000 game test sample). XP allows unlimited undos up to the point of dealing a new row or the point of last completion of a suit. Though I do not have significant data set for Vista, you can take undos past deals and suit completions, so I would think the possible win rate is even higher. 1/10  win to loss ratio sounds pretty low, unless you play without undos, which I believe ruins the spirit of the game; the undos allow you to move cards and discover what is underneath every possible car to play, in effect crawling through the deck like a spider (whereas with Free Cell, you have view of the whole deck, and can make your play strategy in its entirety before you make a move).<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Rijzor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rijzor (page does not exist)">Rijzor</a> 14:16, 26 July 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>with an open deal or unlimited undo, I can win &gt;90% of 4-suit double-deck spider.  closed-deal no-undo drops my success down to about 20%, but I haven't refined my strategy much (it's tedious to play a full game).  I once read somewhere that almost all spider deals are winnable, but I don't remember where.  I'll try to track it down.  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/209.131.62.114" title="Special:Contributions/209.131.62.114">209.131.62.114</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:209.131.62.114&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:209.131.62.114 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:18, August 25, 2007 (UTC)</small></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I would assume that "chance of winning" means no redealing (e.g. if you get five Kings on the first deal) and no undos. Even with those restrictions, however, after extensive research (132 games on "difficult" in Windows solitaire), I can report a win rate of 28%, significantly higher than the 10% the article mentions. I know Wikipedia has a policy of no original research, but since the reference the article cites gives no source for its estimate, and since in practice it appears to be incorrect, pending further clarification, I will take out that sentence. <a href="/wiki/User:JudahH" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 15:20, 6 September 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree the winnability should only be based on a) the full game (not the crippled versions with less colors that MS uses) and b) without cheating (undo beyond the point that reveals information not available beforehand). One could argue that even a regular undo should not be allowed. If I play that way, I do also get a win ration of roughly 20%, a little lower than JudaH. --<a href="/wiki/User:Schoelle" title="User:Schoelle">Schoelle</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Schoelle" title="User talk:Schoelle">talk</a>) 05:48, 13 May 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You can't really call something "cheating" when it's a scored feature of the game.  Windows version 6.1 (included with Windows 7) allows unlimited undos back to the original deal (with each undo scored as a move).  Under this version, every game is winnable (I'm currently on a streak of 69 wins; my previous streak was 189 wins, and was only broken when I accidentally exited in the middle of a game).  You might have an argument that this aren't the "best" rules to use, but it isn't cheating within these rules... and this is certainly one of the most widely distributed versions of the game.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/98.71.104.64" title="Special:Contributions/98.71.104.64">98.71.104.64</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:98.71.104.64" title="User talk:98.71.104.64">talk</a>) 06:29, 30 September 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>After 1 month playing the XP version, I have yet to lose a game! All one has to do is 'save' the game on exit and neither a win nor loss will register in the statistics.  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/69.231.243.201" title="Special:Contributions/69.231.243.201">69.231.243.201</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:69.231.243.201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:69.231.243.201 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:41, 11 December 2007 (UTC)</small>

<dl><dd>After playing both the Linux and Windows(4 suit) versions over the last ten years, I have yet to find a game that is not ultimately winnable - after endless undos and restarts. I find this truly remarkable. I doubt it is a feature of the game, but it may be due to the method used to deal in these two versions.  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/78.146.215.153" title="Special:Contributions/78.146.215.153">78.146.215.153</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:78.146.215.153&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:78.146.215.153 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:56, 27 April 2008 (UTC)</small></dd></dl>

</p><p>Therefore if general consensus were to conclude that there are too many links, I would suggest that links pointing to sites requiring additional software (such as flash) be  removed before removing a link that points to a website that is accessible to a wider majority of Wikipedia readers.

<dl><dd>All of the external links to play the game have been removed.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I would agree that having multiple links to implementations of the game do not conform to the spirit of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> guidelines. However I do believe that having one link pointing to an accurate reference implementation of the game should be considered valid.</dd>
<dd>It has been proposed that games are actually media. In fact <a href="/wiki/W.J.T._Mitchell" class="mw-redirect" title="W.J.T.

<dd>In this case the following <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> 'What should be linked' Item #2 guideline applies:
<ul><li>"An article about a book, a musical score, or some other media should link to a site hosting a copy of the work if none of the "Links normally to be avoided" criteria apply."</li></ul></dd>
<dd>In other words, an implementation of the game would be valid as long as none of the "Links normally to be avoided" criteria apply."</dd>
<dd>I submit that the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://worldofsolitaire.com/index.html?optionGame=Spider">World of Solitaire - Spider</a> link meets the criteria required by the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> guidelines and that the usefulness of a link to an actual free implementation of the game would be of benefit to users.</dd>
<dd>The implementation clearly does not violate any of the 'Links normally to be avoided' criteria. The link:
<ul><li>Is 100% Free and Not Commercial</li>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I disagree.  Games are not media on Wikipedia, irregardless of one professor may have decided.  There is no reason to link to any version of the game and they do not meet the criteria for acceptable links.  Usefulness in and of itself is not a reason for external links, only adding to the encyclopedic knowledge.  One does not have to play the game in order to have an encyclopedic understanding.  At best, one link to a DMOZ category that has links to the various games might be acceptable, however by linking to any version of the game it gives the appearance that it is Wikipedia endorsed or improved (even if it obviously isn't). <a href="/wiki/User:AnmaFinotera" title="User:AnmaFinotera">AnmaFinotera</a> 15:28, 16 November 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Another point, the list of links is extremely stable.  I have had this page on my watchlist for at least a year, and I think only one link has been questioned in the past.

<p>Perhaps it might be well to compare this issue to its appearance in other Wikipedia articles:  there are PLENTY of links like these on other parallel (and not so parallel) pages and no one seems to have a problem with them.  Indeed on many pages for celebrities, there are links to commercial sites whose only goal is to sell material to users.  I think a rational argument can be constructed that one cannot have "encyclopedic" knowledge of a game without playing it.  Anyone bothered by the links need not use them, but anyone who needs the links or finds them useful cannot use them if they are deleted.  Collectonian has obviously strong feelings about the matter and I respect that;  I would ask her that she kindly refrain from labeling those who disagree with her as engaging in "vandalism" as that is clearly an inappropriate term for an intellectual disagreement.  In cases of honest disagreement, my hunch is that we need to err on the side of "more" rather than "less" content on the page and trust the readers of the page to use what they need and leave the rest alone. <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:206.74.61.67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:206.74.61.67 (page does not exist)">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">contribs</a>) 14:28, 18 November 2007</span></small>

<dl><dd>When it comes to external links, the guideline is less is more, not more is better.  If there are links on celebrity articles that's soul purpose is to sell stuff, they should be removed.  External links are rarely checked except in cases of obvious spam, and people frequently get by with adding their favorite pet links, especially on smaller articles like this that have few, if any, regular editors watching them.  EL may not be a policy, but it is a guideline, and a darn good one.  One does not need to play football to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the game, nor does one need to play Spider Solitaire to have encyclopedic knowledge of the game.</dd></dl>
<p>If we are going to have links to the games, then fairness would dictate that we link to every single online version of the game out there that doesn't blatantly break policies about linking to malware or illegal sites.  Such a list would, of course, be ridiculous and useless.  Who is to say that the specific versions links to in this article currently are any better than any of the rest?  What authority has declared them to be the definitive examples of the game?  I'd say none.  They are simply there because they happened to be ones added by someone who just happened to like that version of the game.  One could easily find dozens more versions online, not to mention the plethora of off-line versions.  
</p><p>These links to specific games are no more encyclopedic or useful than having a running list of every last downloadable or installable version of the game would be. <a href="/wiki/User:AnmaFinotera" title="User:AnmaFinotera">AnmaFinotera</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AnmaFinotera" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:AnmaFinotera">talk</a>) 21:34, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>I see your point, but respectfully disagree.  As Collectonian correctly points out, having links to every single version would be ridiculous, but it isn't ridiculous to have links to a small number of appropriate, non-commercial sites where the game can be played.  As to "what authority" declares them to be the best--none.  The whole idea behind Wikipedia is that users can update and improve the pages continually.  If someone finds a "better" version of the game out there, by all means substitute a link to it for the link to the "inferior" version here.  My plea is to leave a modest number of links to the game so that readers of the page can easily and readily try their hand at what they've just been reading about!  I don't see a "fairness" issue here as Wikipedia is not linking folks to sites that make money from their visitors, so no other non-listed site is being "cheated" out of anything.  Linking to a small number of sites where the game can be played does provide a benefit to readers of the page, whereas no additional benefit would accrue were the links to be exhaustive, so the thrust of Collectonian's argument  about the dozens and dozens of versions out there seems to be without merit.
</p><p>I don't want to be negative here, but my gut tells me that Collectonian doesn't actually use the page to find information about the game herself.  Perhaps those who do actually use the page to obtain information might be better suited to deciding whether the link is useful (i.e., as there is no consensus on whether the mere presence of the links violates Wikipedia policy--and please bear in mind we are talking about "guidelines" for links and not hard and fast rules). As she points out, such links are "rarely checked," so perhaps we could check these particular links a bit more rarely than has been the case of late.
</p><p>I certainly don't want to be a grammar cop, but someone of Collectonian's obvious erudition should be aware that there is no such word in the English language as "irregardless" and should know the difference between "soul" and "sole." <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:206.74.61.67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:206.74.61.67 (page does not exist)">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">contribs</a>) 15:49, 18 November 2007</span></small>

<dl><dd>Please sign your posts using the four tildes, and there is no need to get <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" title="Wikipedia:Civility">personal</a> and start attacking a few grammar mistakes or typos.  I did use the page to find out about the game.  I came to an encyclopedia article to learn about its history, background, how its played, etc.  I.E. the actual encyclopedic discussion of the game.  I personally play it on Neopets or my Windows version.  I suspect many people who might come look up the article have already been exposed to the game and want to learn more about it, not have to sift through pet links to find a version to play.  Wikipedia is not a link directory, and that's all those links are serving as: a few editors personal link directory to their preferred versions of the game.  <a href="/wiki/User:AnmaFinotera" title="User:AnmaFinotera">AnmaFinotera</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AnmaFinotera" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:AnmaFinotera">talk</a>) 22:14, 18 November 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I apologize if my reference to your being erudite offended--it was not intended to do so.  If we are not getting personal, perhaps we should refrain from describing links which multiple users have found to be useful as "editor's <i>personal</i> link directory."

<dl><dd>I have had this article on my watch list for at least a year, and in that time, I have never seen a bloat on external links to "every version of the game."  In fact, the list has been very stable.  A few more commercial sites have been removed, and every once in a while, someone decides to remove the entire list (as we have now).  I will summarize:</dd>
<dd>* <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> is a guideline and not a policy</dd>
<dd>* There is precidence on other articles for keeping such links around</dd>
<dd>* The guideline actually says nothing about linking to games, only to appropriate sources.</dd>
<dd>* Spider is not copyrighted (as far as I know) so I see it being no different than linking to the text of the "<a href="/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Wizard of Oz">Wizard of Oz</a>" provided the site is not overtly commercial.</dd>
<dd>* The list of links has been stable, and has not become a dumping ground for every version of the game around.</dd>
<dd>So, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  In fact, other than not sticking to a strict interpretation of a guideline, I see no drawbacks at all. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 19:07, 19 November 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>So far, the only reason that has really been put forward for keeping it all seems to be  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ILIKEIT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, which is not a valid reason for keeping the links at all. There is a big difference between a game with multiple versions, and a single definitive novel which is now in the public domain.  There are not multiple versions of novels floating around, so one can easily point to a version that is a definitive version.  There are, potentially, an unlimited number of versions of Spider floating around.  Linking to a few choice versions is not being neutral, nor is it actually beneficial or useful.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> may not be a policy, but being a guideline doesn't mean it should so easily be shoved aside just because it doesn't support the addition of links that are not necessary for an article. You've also just admitted, you don't know the copyright status of the game's electronic version.  How can you say for absolutely certainly that none of the online games in those link are not violating a copyright or patent?  Are any built on the Windows version or from someone else's patented or copyright version?  <a href="/wiki/User:AnmaFinotera" title="User:AnmaFinotera">AnmaFinotera</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AnmaFinotera" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:AnmaFinotera">talk</a>) 19:55, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Please be specific on what you feel is wrong with these links.  And WP:ILIKEIT is just as valid as WP:IDONTLIKEIT.  I have given five solid points on why they should be included, and I have yet to hear one solid rebuttal.  I agree that a single version of the game would be ideal, but if I found several online versions of a book (in the public domain) I would be alright linking to any and all of them provided they do not violate additional WP:EL criteria.  Honestly the only WP:EL criteria I can see being valid would be games that require downloads or special plug-ins, which to my understanding, none currently do.  And, I will reiterate my biggest point:  This list of links has been stable for well over a year.  There is no fear of it growing out of hand.

<p>Collectonian is absolutely wrong that there are not "multiple versions of novels floating around."  A simple check into the bibliography for Henry James, for instance, easily shows that there are usually three distinct versions of his major novels, sometimes QUITE different (the original serial publication, the original bound publication, and the "New York" edition revised and produced late in his lifetime).  A student or scholar needs to decide what version of <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, for example, s/he wishes to read (the early "Realist" version or the late "Modernist" version, whose endings and even styles are quite radically different). In addition, there are multiple versions of novels by many other canonical writers (Charles Dickens, James Joyce--even Stephen King has authorized two versions of one of his most popular novels, <i>The Stand</i>.)  If there are different versions of Spider Solitaire, I'd suggest that this be discussed in the entry and links be provided to an example of each major variation.  Collectonian also misrepresents this continuing discussion by saying that the only reason the links are provided is "I like it";  several folks (here in the discussion and in the edit summaries) have indicated their usefulness and listed a variety of reasons for keeping them.  At the very least this constitutes "We" like it.  An editor "liking" something is no reason to discount it;  on her own page, Collectonian herself refers to a lengthy number of entries as her "babies."  I assume she believes these entries are of interest and use to others, so the mere fact that she likes them wouldn't alone indicate they should be deleted (or maybe, following her reasoning, we need to mark them for deletion?).<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 15:30, 20 November 2007 (UTC)

<p>What this seems to come down to is that Collectonian (alone, as far as I can see) says, "I don't like these links" and thinks that trumps the fact that multiple other users find the links to be a positive contribution.  Several different folks now have pointed out logical flaws or downright inaccuracies in what Collectonian writes;  she seems to have a problem with admitting error.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 17:17, 20 November 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>im Collectorian's defense, there has been past debate on links, and some of the links added were downright inappropriate, requiring sign-ups, plug-ins or overly apundandant advertising, but those issues have been hashed out, and the list of links has been stable.

They certainly do not have exhaustive detail that can't be included in the article.  They are just essentially interchangeable game screens.  having more than one is pointless, as is arguing about which one to have. A Dmoz category link is the only choice there.  These solitaire artciles get spammed with non-unique more than almost all Wiki articles since interchangeable where to play links are just that, interchangeable and add no unique value to the article -- in other words, while "where to play" may or may not merit an external link, having more than one that are basically the same makes no sense. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 07:55, 7 December 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The majority of contributers to the discussion above have expressed interest in keeping external links. If there is to be removal of certain links, but keeping of others, I'd like to note that World of Solitaire is one that certainly deserves to be kept. Requiring no flash, no java, no installs with no ads or commercial aspect at all. It also supports all five major browsers FF, IE, Safari, Konqueror and Opera. In addition, it implements the solitaire versions strictly to the rules. I'm the creator of the site and I am continuing to add more Solitaire implementations (currently it has 24). I want it to be THE reference site for seeing a correct implementation of a Solitaire game. I also at some point want to propose a clean-up to all the Wikipedia pages on Solitaire to use a newly created Solitaire template along with perhaps screenshots from World of Solitaire to give the articles more consistency. I would also be updating the pages with the correct rules where needed. I also want to stress that I make zero money from the site and the number of hits from Wikipedia is far lower than those I get from other sources such as Google and pages that have written about my site. So I am NOT doing this out of some sort of greedy effort to swindle wikipedia viewers to my site. I truly believe the site is useful to those viewing Wikipedia. I believe this viewpoint is shared by the vast majority of editors as evidenced by the above discussion. <a href="/wiki/User:Sembiance" title="User:Sembiance">Sembiance</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sembiance" title="User talk:Sembiance">talk</a>) 12:55, 7 December 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Including links to your own sites, especially when that makes up the bulk of your editing activity, is a pretty big hint that your purpose is to use the Wikipedia to advertise your site.

<dl><dd>I see what you are saying and I understand. I still believe that *if* external links to implementations of the Solitaire game are decided to be included for Solitaire pages, that World of Solitaire should be included for all the reasons I have mentioned above. However I also understand the other point of view that you and others have made about how there shouldn't be any external links to any playable versions. So clearly based on above discussions, there is disagreement over what to do with the links. How exactly is a decision decided and how is such a decision enforced? It seems to me that when there is clear disagreement that there needs to be some sort of 'final word' or else the pages will just keep going back and forth forever.

<p>This lengthy discussion prompted me to check something out:  The Washington Post entry has a link to washingtonpost.com (as I would expect).  This site has advertising and requires registration (I think - if not the NY Times site does).

<p>The external links guideline states that links to normally avoid include those that do "provide a unique resource..."  Several links which on their face violate this principle keep being inappropriately added to this article.  Having several links that are nothing but "play online" can't possibly be justified.  On top of that, the answer to "why these" among the many play online possibilities out there is mostly because the solitaire articles have been COI spammed to death over the years.  Since "play online" links are redundant and provide no unique resource, and since there are so many possibilities, either none should be listed or the solution the external links guideline reccomends, linking to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dmoz.org/Games/Video_Games/Recreation/Browser_Based/Cards/Solitaire/">appropriate Dmoz category</a> should be chosen.  Once the DMOZ category is added, the issue is settled. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 03:06, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The links on this page have been stable now for nearly two years.  Any link that voilates the policies of advertising, plugins, etc., are removed immediately.  The remaining few links are different versions. I personally prefer the Green Felt version.  Other people have expressed a preference to other versions, so as long as they don't voilate the the above criteria, they have remained.  The link section is stable, so they do not "keep being inappropriately added to this article," as you claim.  You say there are "so many possibilities," but in fact, the history of this page shows that very few are actually added, and those that are blatent spam are removed immediately, shows this fact.  I challenge you to find all of these versions floating around.  I have looked, and found maybe 7 versions.  There are not dozens or hundreds of versions out there.   There are very few, and of those, only the ones listed have no spam or plug-ings.  So my summary given 4 months ago still stands, and nothing has changed. That's called stability.  Do not make it out to be anything else. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 17:05, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Stable is irrelevant.  The fact that you prefer one version also is irrelevant.  Three duplicate ways to play are a blatant violation of the external links guideline.  Additionally your insistence on duplicating Master Rankings link is just weird.  Obviously that will continue to be reverted. Don't add the duplicate again. Then finally if there are only seven versions of playing online, these three should not be linked just because they were inappropriately added, and adding the other four is not the solution.  You know very well having these three play online links directly, obviously violates <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>.  The second and third play online links add literally nothing.  You know this so I'll give you a chance to remove them yourself. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 21:15, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Stable is absolutely relevant.  Your objection was that the list was going to become to large.  Stability completely refutes that.  Second, a guideline is just that, not law.  Third, I didn't add the Master Rankings, and don't really care about it.  It was left when others deleted the other links, so I assumed that it was not part of this discussion.  If you have an objection with that link, then discuss that link, rather than throw all the links into the same pot.  The three links do not voilate WP:EL in any way.  There is no adverstising, and no needed plug-ins.  Your objections are unfounded.  You claimed there were dozens if not hundreds of versions floating out there.  I see you are backing off of that claim.  Each link is perfectly acceptable.   If you bothered to read the entire content of the Talk discussions, you would see that.  It has been hashed before, and it still hasn't changed the fact that these links are appropriate. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 21:26, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Stable is never an issue.  If spam has been there for two years, it should be removed on sight.  My objection is not that it would become to large.  Do not make stuff up.  Yes it is just a guideline, but it has widespread consensus throughout the encyclopedia.  You can ignore it for your own purposes, but obviously the links will be removed by those who do follow the guidelines of the encyclopedia.  You <b>DID</b> add the Master rankings duplicate link twice.  It appears you don't pay much attention to where comments go, or the actual edits you make, but I'd suggest you get accustomend to clicking the history link at the top of the page you can see what edits do and have entailed.  I'm not backing off any claim.  It doesn't matter if there are seven or seven hundred places to play.  ANY number more than ONE is redundant.  Multipe play links add nothing to the article if there is one play link already.  The guideline is crystal clear.  If it doesn't add anything, don't link.  You are just ignoring the guideline for unstated reasons. I've read the talk discussions.  These links have been COI spammed and are redundant to each other.  They violate multiple guidelines.  You can ignore the guidelines if you want, but that doesn't mean other editors who do follow the guidelines can't remove blatantly inappropriate links. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 22:56, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I have read through <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> and see no criteria that would exclude these links.  Can you please quote the specific section you think these links violate?  The only thing I can see as potentially at issue is promoting a specific website, which is not the case when offering several versions from various links.  If we exclude one site over another, then we would be in violation of promoting a specific site.  Otherwise, I see no other criteria that would exclude them.  I have gone point by point through the list of violations, and none of them apply to these links.  Maybe I am missing something.  <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 02:42, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I already quoted it: "Any site that does not provide a unique resource..."  Obviously two or four or eight or 800 "play online" links provide no unique resource beyond the first play online link.  Different background colors or whatever are just a matter of taste.  That's a slam dunk for starters, but then the links meet none of the criteria for what should be linked, while were COI spammed so fail point 4 of the links to be avoided.  A single link to the Dmoz solitaire category points people to places where the game can be played online or via software.  Listing multiple redundant links is inappropriate.  Choosing one play online link, since there is no offical site, is also inappropriate because there are multiple places where people can play, so just having the Dmoz link solves every issue.  The COI spammers won't like it, but they don't get their way, which is why we have guidelines. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 04:22, 18 March 2008 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The full quote says "Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article."  The links do provide a unique resource that cannot be contained.  I know you are suggesting that only one link is acceptable, and I tend to agree, but I also think it favors one website version over another.   I see no COI issue unless you are supporting one link over all others.  By having multiple links, it avoids COI issues, as people can choose and not be forced to one site over another.  It seems to me that you are pushing a single site, and perhaps you are the one with a COI.  Maybe we should review each link.  I don't see spammer activity, at least not often, and if the site is geared toward ads or revenue, I would delete it.  None of the three sites are in this category.  Favoring the Dmoz link over the others is a clear violation of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> by favoring one site over others.  Not to mention it does require special downloads to use.  <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 04:41, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A Dmoz link is exactly what is suggested by <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>.  The fair solution to not favoring one site by linking to all sites is beyond silly, so I am changing the links to what the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> suggests.  It would be nice if you abided by that guideline. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 06:33, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A Dmoz link is a horrible idea. Dmoz is horribly out of date and it takes years to add new links to Dmoz. Also they only suggest this when there is a long list of links. 2 to 4 links is not a long list of links therefore linking to Dmoz is not appropriate.</dd>
<dd>I myself agree with Bytebear here. Having 2 to 4 links to implementations that comply with the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> guidelines is the best approach. Several reasons in the guidelines show that the World of Solitaire and Greenfelt.net links are valid:
<ul><li>[From What Should be Linked] Sites that contain neutral and accurate material that cannot be integrated into the Wikipedia article due to copyright issues, amount of detail or other reasons.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Clearly implementations of the game contains much more detail than the Wikipedia article can ever cover. Also it wouldn't be desirable to put the game right on the Wikipedia page itself so therefore an external link is called for.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>[From What Should be Considered] Sites which fail to meet criteria for reliable sources yet still contain information about the subject of the article from knowledgeable sources.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Linking to 2 to 4 implementations of the game meets this criteria. Each implementation will probably interpret the rules, board layout and gameplay slightly differently and this is information which can only be given to the wikipedia reader through the use of an external link.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>In addition, the external links to do not violate ANY of the 'Links Normally to be avoided' section. Therefore these links are fully valid and useful to the reader.</dd>
<dd>The only potential argument to be made against them is conflict of interest. This is something that 2005 and other users brought up on other pages about my adding of World of Solitaire to those pages. Although I strongly disagree with the policy, I decided that I would no longer re-add links to World of Solitaire myself when other editors have removed them. Instead what I have done is follow existing guidelines on this matter and propose the links on the Talk page. In some cases other Wikipedia editors have seen the value in these links and have re-added them to the page themselves. In other cases I could not get any other editors involved besides myself and the one wanting the link removed. I tried to point these editors to this Spider talk page where this has been discussed already, however they did not appear take me up on that. Since I am not the one involved in the actual removing or adding of this particular link in this case, COI is not an issue in this case. Therefore Bytebear is correct. <a href="/wiki/User:Sembiance" title="User:Sembiance">Sembiance</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sembiance" title="User talk:Sembiance">talk</a>) 13:11, 18 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Why is a link to where to play appropriate?  Should th blackjack article link to the Bellagio?  This is an encyclopedia.  Linking to sites where to play is not the point.  And encyclopedic article is.  Most of these links offer zero information about the game, but rather are just game screens on commercial sites using the Wikipedia as a way to troll for customers.  Additionally, if someone wants to offer pointers to where to play, then the only possible link is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.dmoz.org/Games/Video_Games/Recreation/Cards/Solitaire/Freeware/">a Dmoz category</a>.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>This is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. Normal encyclopedias have neither videos, nor weblinks, nor millions of editors. Why should we restrict ourselves by the old standards of what an encyclopedia is?</dd>
<dd>The whole idea behind an encyclopedia is to spread knowledge. What better way to do that for a card game than to actually play the card game? As I suggested originally and per Wikipedia standards, don't allow links to commercial websites, which solves most of the problems you bring up. I don't see what wrong with linking to sites like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://worldofsolitaire.com/">http://worldofsolitaire.com/</a> where there's no commercial gain, it's just another free website like Wikipedia.

<dl><dd>How many such links do you want?  One, four, twenty?  Wikipedia does allow links to commercial websites. What it doesn't allow are links that are essentially only commercial.  The fact that this link currently is non-commercial really doesn't matter since just because there is not a guidline against soemthing doesn't mean everything non-commercial can be added.  Also, there is clear commercial gain by linking to such a website since that site just became more valuable and could be sold.  If there was one single play online site for a game, then sure that could add value.  But just picking one is silly and almost always colored by self-interest, and having more than one is purely redundant.  There is an easy solution, normally, to just link to a Dmoz category that has several such "play here" sites listed. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 05:18, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I will repeat myself.  I have had this article on my watchlist for over 2 years.  I have never seen more than 5 or 6 links ever.  The list is very stable.

<dl><dd>See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>. One relevant guideline is item #4 on the list of links to normally be avoided. Links normally to be avoided include "links mainly intended to promote a website". The user who originally added that link made no contributions to the Wikipedia beyond dropping links to his website, and when he was encouraged to contribute in other ways, he said he would prefer not to contribute here since his links had been removed. That's clear evidence that the link was included mainly to promote a website. Rewarding that behavior by re-adding those links encourages spammers. Dozens of websites offer online solitaire games. We shouldn't link to them all. Linking to the appropriate DMOZ category is the suggested and correct approach. See item #3 of links to be considered in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>.</dd>
<dd>I am not playing favorites, and I don't have any kind of bias. That's a personal attack and a failure to assume good faith on my part.

Three redundant links is silly, and the conflict of interest defense of them is beyond childish.  The external links guideline states a solution to this circumstance, which is the Dmoz link.  the fact that perhaps some of these links aren't in Dmoz is a pure "who cares" thing.  Only the COI webmasters care.  We are here to make an encyslopedia, not promote somebody's site.  the redundant links will be removed, as will any others that are spammed.  The Dmoz link covers everything that needs to be covered: information, software, play online.  There is no reason the solitaire articles should be treated differently than the rest of the encyclopedia, even if somebody wants to get traffic from them. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 23:42, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I could see your point *if* the promoted website was in violation of other WP:EL issues, and as I recall, the World of Solitaire was on this page for at least a year, and I never saw a problem with it.  For the record I have no connection with any external solitaire website.  So, do you think the all of the IMDB websites should be removed as well?  They certainly have more violations of WP:EL than the links on this page. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 00:53, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Just because a spammed link survived doesn't mean it should have.  There is only one IMDb website so I don't know what you mean by that. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 05:13, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It should be taken into consideration that Dmoz is years out of date and does not respond to addition requests. I thought the idea behind wikipedia was to be relevant, up to date and useful to the reader. Removing these links would make Wikipedia less relevant, far less up to date and far less useful to the reader. It would be one thing if relevant, current links could be added to Dmoz and then you could link every page in Wikipedia to Dmoz. However that's not the case and thats why so many Wikipedia articles contain direct external links. This should be no different in this case. Also Dmoz links are only to advised to be used where you have a lot of links. I think it's reasonable to say that 2 to 3 links does not constitute 'a lot'. I'm doing this out of a motivation to help people and to enhance Wikipedia to be more useful to the readers. These links accomplish this. Since user 2005 and Rray does not appear to be willing to compromise at all, my hope is that other Wikipedia editors will be able to solve this. I guess if in the end it doesn't get resolved, that just means wikipedia is less relevant, less useful and less up to date than it could be, and if that's the way it is in the end, well, so be it.<a href="/wiki/User:Sembiance" title="User:Sembiance">Sembiance</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sembiance" title="User talk:Sembiance">talk</a>) 14:15, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Since you have a clear conflict of interest in this case, perhaps it might make sense to let the rest of the community decide about the inclusion of your links, and work on something here where you don't have a conflict of interest? Since the bulk of your editing here has been to insist on the inclusion of a link to your website, your contention that you only wish to help make Wikipedia more relevant and useful rings a little hollow.

<dl><dd>I don't have a conflict of interest, and I think you and 2005 are more upset at the user than at the content.  The motivations of a user does not negate the content they present.

<dl><dd>I didn't suggest that you have a conflict of interest; I pointed out that Sembiance does. I suggested that he let people who don't have a conflict of interest discuss this. Do you think that's somehow an inappropriate suggestion to make?</dd>
<dd>I'm not upset by anything, and I haven't "attacked" anyone. Your theories about my motivations are irrelevant to the discussion. Sembiance's conflict of interest is relevant - see #4 of links normally to be avoided in the external links guidelines for why that's relevant here.</dd>
<dd>As far as why the link shouldn't be included, links to sites where you can play video games are of lower value than a link to a DMOZ category that includes links to several such games. That's what's suggested by the external links guidelines, and that's what should be implemented here. Why do you think it's so important to include a link to a particular playable video game? <a href="/wiki/User:Rray" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rray" title="User talk:Rray">talk</a>) 17:07, 22 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>(outdent)  Zmoz is appropriate for long lists.  3 links does not apply.  And, having read all of the comments, I have found Sembiance to be very polite and willing to work on an appropriate solution.  He hasn't removed competing links or disrupted the page to support his links above any others.   I will accuse you of not assuming good faith.

<dl><dd>Of course three links apply.  The external links guideline addresses this point explicitly.  These links were initially spammed anyway.  This obstinace is really around the bend now.  Solitaire articles are no 'special'. To start with, play online links are not listed in the monopoly article, or the chess article, or the online poker article, gin rummy article, etc etc etc.  Editors with thousands of edits in all types of articles have pointed out the guidelines, while the only counter arguments are a single purpose account saying "my website is good" and another editor saying <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ILIKEIT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a>.  The redundant links are inappropriate in several ways and a Dmoz link is the called for solution. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 04:08, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Here are my points
<ul><li>The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> specifically says "<b>Long lists of links are not appropriate</b>: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#LINK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links</a>. If you find a <b>long list of links</b> in an article, you can tag the "External links" section with the &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:External_links" title="Template:External links">External links</a>&#125;&#125; template. Where editors have not reached consensus on an appropriate list of links, a link to a well chosen web directory category could be used until such consensus can be reached. The <a href="/wiki/Open_Directory_Project" class="mw-redirect" title="Open Directory Project">Open Directory Project</a> is often a neutral candidate, and may be added using the &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Dmoz" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>&#125;&#125; template."
<ul><li>A list of three does not qualify as long by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
<li>This list has been stable for well over a year, nearing two, and has never been in danger of being too long.  Consensus was met long before any edits by Sembiance.</li>
<li>The dmoz is not comprehensive, and out of date, and currently does not duplicate these links, so is not a mirror image, and fails on this point.</li>
<li>The dmoz is a suggestion for dealing with long lists, not a requirement, and certainly not a standard.</li>
<li>These links have been on this page for nearly two years, maybe longer.  I have been watching a lot longer than you, and they were not put on as "spam."  That is simply not true. And spam doesn't apply anyway, unless you feel that IMDB is also a spam site.</li></ul></li>
<li>Monopoly is a copyrighted game, and as such <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> is in violation because of that reason.  A reason that does not apply to this or other solitaire games.</li>
<li>I have never used <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ILIKEIT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a> as an argument.  In fact, I have said that I prefer the green felt version, but feel the inclusion of various versions disallows for favoring one link over another.</li>
<li>Having multiple links actually fulfills <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a> which says that no link should be favored over another.  Having three links validates this rule.  I will repeat, THREE LINKS IS NOT A LONG LIST.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Feel free to debate these points, but your point are not valid.  These links simply do not violate WP:EL. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 04:47, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Repeatedly making false assertions just makes even reading you messages an unproductive use of time.  the assertion that these external links have been "stable" is utterly fantastic.  The edit history of this page contains edit after edit after edit after edit of spamming, deleting and respamming.  The flash redirect thing that you yourself deleted more than once has been added and removed from this page many, many times in the past two years.  Stability is no criteria at all, but the assertion this page has been stable is either beyond ludicrous, and you know that.  The Dmoz suggestion in fact is standard, and it is suggested for a reason.  I think you neeed to go to the esternal links page if you want to try and reinvent the guideline.  Also the argument Dmoz isn't comprehensive is ridiculous.  Not only is Wikipedia not comptrehensive, it is NOT supposed to be.  Dmoz is a link directory.  It has links to play online sites.  You need to understand that we are not here to protect some site links that were spammed here repeatedly.  Dmoz's link list is way more than comprehensive enough.  <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 09:24, 23 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

You see, this is <i>still ostensibly</i> an encyclopedic project. Articles and every single bit in them must be committed <i>only</i> to discuss, explain and illustrate the topic at hand. Everything else is inappropriate, and any "play online" links are unacceptable unless the website in question is itself the focus of a dedicated article or section or otherwise indispensable for a complete and accurate article.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The external links guidelines indicate that The DMOZ link should be used until consensus is reached concerning the addition of the other links. So far two users think these links should be included, and one of those doesn't count because he has a conflict of interest. Three users think these links should not be included. That is clearly not a consensus to include these links, so I've removed the disputed links until consensus is reached.</dd>
<dd>Regarding Bytebear's bullet points above, none of them are valid reason to include these links. DMOZ not being comprehensive or being irrelevant is a debate that should be brought up on the external links guidelines talk page, not here. Saying that the list consists of "only 3 links" isn't a valid reason for including them either. The bullet point about the list being stable isn't accurate, but even if it were correct, it's not relevant. Just because links haven't been removed for over a year doesn't mean that they're appropriate for inclusion. Having multiple links might fulfill <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EL">WP:EL</a>, but only if the multiple links are appropriate.</dd>
<dd>Drawing comparisons to other game articles is perfectly appropriate here. We have an article about poker, but we don't include links to every placed on the Internet where you can play poker for free. We have an article about chess, but we don't include links to every place on the Internet where you can play chess online.

<dl><dd>So now you are arguing removal of all external links instead of the one in question.  You are shifting arguments because there is nothing that violates WP:EL for these links.  Nothing says that a game implementation should be avoided.  And DMOZ is only suggested (not required or even recommended) when a list is long (not the case here) or when it is duplicated in the DMOZ (also not applicable).  I am sorry, but I still don't believe these links are inappropriate, and seeing the shift in your position, I see you cannot find substantial reason to remove them.  <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 03:56, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

<dd>These are indeed several aspects of WP:EL that are violated by all of those links. Moreoever, all but one are Java-based, which is decidely discouraged anyway. However, I think we don't even need EL to arrive at the conclusion that "play online" links are simply not encyclopedically justifiable.

<dl><dd>Actually, all are JavaScript based, a de-facto standard for web browers. None of them require log-in, special downloads, or contain advertising of any kind.  There is nothing in WP:EL discouraging "play online" games, other than a warning about copyright violations,].  Online game play does indeed "provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Feature article".  The links do not need to be encyclopedic.  And I still hear the argument that "Links should be kept at a minimum."  there are only three links.  This is not excessive or a "long list."  Again, no voilations.  I would like to know, specifically, what " aspects of WP:EL that are violated by all of those links" because I have not found even one aspect.  <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 19:18, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

<p>MANY folks on this discussion page and on the edit history page have defended the links and I don't need to repeat their arguments.

<dl><dd>So far there is no consensus to include the links, and there has been no valid reason given for their inclusion. Three Wikipedians have given valid reasons for deleting these links, one (Sembiance) has argued for their inclusion based on his conflict of interest, and one (ByteBear) has argued that they should be included but gives no valid reason why they should be included.

<p>The anonymous user (me) referred you to the lengthy discussion of their usefulness above.  Since you obviously didn't take the time to go back through the discussion, I'll repeat it again:  the links provide readers an opportunity to play the game they've just read about without having to so elsewhere in search of the game;  in an "existentialist" sense, one cannot really "know" a game if one has merely read about it, but must play it in order really to know it, so the links provide an "encycolpedic" function that is otherwise missing;  since Wikipedia is on-line, there are no space limitations which might prevent their inclusion;  as long as no commercial sites are linked, the Wikipedia rules are not violated.  Your contiued insistence on deleting the links without bothering to familiarize yourself with the history of their inclusion as detailed on this page is inappropriate.  PLEASE STOP DELETING THE LINKS.  If you feel you have some valid points to make about why they shouldn't be there, make those points here while LEAVING THE LINKS IN PLACE so that the discussion is not shut down arbitrarily at your whim. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 21:42, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I've read the entire discussion, thanks. Please don't shout by typing in all caps; it's rude. The guidelines are that the links should not be included without a consensus for inclusion, not vice-versa. A DMOZ link is the suggested solution. The links can be included on the talk page here for discussion purposes, but I don't think anyone misunderstands or disagrees about the content of the sites. They consist of free-play versions of the game. <a href="/wiki/User:Rray" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rray" title="User talk:Rray">talk</a>) 21:48, 24 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>As has repeatedly been noted above DMOZ is out of date and cumbersome.  It would also require users to leave Wikipedia in order to find information that could readily be included at the end of the article.  There is no consensus, but the CLEAR (caps have a purpose and I'm using them purposively) majority of those writing here want them.  You have a problem with majority rule (or do you just like imposing your will on others)?  Continuing to remove the links without greater support (both in terms of number of supporters and in terms of logical argument) is really inappropriate and childish.  You should at least attempt to control yourself and not do it.
</p>
<dl><dd>The external links you're wanting to add also require a user to leave the Wikipedia, so that doesn't even make sense. If you disagree that DMOZ links are appropriate, the right place to discuss that is the guidelines page for the Wikipedia external links guidelines, which is where that approach is recommended. And Wikipedia doesn't run on a majority vote; it works on consensus. Right now there is no consensus to include the links. (There's not a majority either.) In the absence of consensus, the links aren't supposed to be included in the article. Calling me "childish" and accusing me of lacking self-control is a personal attack, which doesn't strengthen your argument or help you achieve your goal. <a href="/wiki/User:Rray" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rray" title="User talk:Rray">talk</a>) 22:02, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

I merely described your behavior and seem to have hit a tender spot.  Perhaps you have had troubles like this in other areas of your life?   To state that Wikipedia operates on consensus is ridiculous;  if that were so, most of the articles on it could not exist (this one certainly could not) as there simply is no consensus and never will be.  The links are useful.  MANY, MANY people above and on the edit summaries have stated that this is so and (comparatively) a tiny number of people continually delete them apparently just because they don't like them.  Can't you spend your time more productively than deleting things other people use???  <small>—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 22:05, 24 March 2008 (UTC)</small>

<p>It's clear there is no consensus to have these links, and in fact everyone except a website owner and one other editor oppose their inclusion.  A consensus is need to have links, not the other way around, so it's time to move on. <a href="/wiki/User:2005" title="User:2005">2005</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2005" title="User talk:2005">talk</a>) 07:08, 25 March 2008 (UTC)
</p><p>2005 is demonstrably wrong to claim that only a website owner and one other editor oppose the links.  In the discussion above, I count myself (206.74.61.67), Bytebear, Sembience, Calibes, Ghaller, and Plinkit as supporting inclusion.  That's 300% more folks than 2005 acknowledges.  There are others who support inclusion in the edit summaries, but I don't have time to count them.  The bottom line:  those who don't like the links need not use them and are not harmed by their inclusion, but those who use the links are indeed at least inconvenienced by their removal.

<p>Well, all of your "points" have been refuted above, but I'll repeat.  This is a page about a game.  I think a sound argument can be made that one does not "know" a game unless one has "played" it.  Of course, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a link repository;  no one has suggested otherwise.  The question is:  do Wikipedia entries provide links relevant to their subject matter?  The answer, overwhelmingly, is yes.  I agree wholly that consensus in unimportant;  those who wish to delete the links keep raising that red herring.  The problem with the links is that the definition of "relevant" is unclear.  Some--like me--think an unobtrusive pathway to playing the game on a non-commercial site is "relevant" and others do not.  I don't attempt to "force" others to adopt my point of view as anyone who dislikes the links is free to ignore them.  The "deleters," on the other hand, do attempt to force their point of view on the majority of us in this discussion who wish to keep them.  <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 18:07, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

<p>2005's remarks above are intemperate and rude;  they clearly violate Wikipedia rules on civility.  To characterize contributions to a discussion page as "spam" is so illogical that I can only point out its absurdity.  For 2005's information:  I have no website.  I barely know how to turn a computer on and could certainly never build or maintain a website.  I can't even use Excel.  I am, in fact, a wee bit of a Luddite, as I am old enough to remember rotary dial telephones (hell, I'm STILL using a rotary dial telephone), black and white TVs, and the handheld electronic calculators which were heavy and became hot to the touch if used to add a long list of numbers.  If 2005 is correct that there is a clear majority against the links, s/he should simply list here the user IDs of those on each side of the question and provide a count.  I think such a count would show that those in favor of the links outnumber those opposed to them by a margin of around 3 to 1 (that margin certainly applies to this discussion page, but I acknowledge I haven't actually counted those on the edit summaries for this article).  I don't "log in" because I am not a "registered user."  I object to any website collecting the information from me necessary to "register."  Wikipedia certainly does not require editors to register at any rate. I don't want to be a grammar cop, but the correct usage is "try TO promote," not "try AND promote."  <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 23:09, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>my position is simply.  game implementations do not violate WP:EL.   If Pac-Man were copyright free, I would be perfectly fine with a link to an implementation of it as well.  and I would fight as much for that site.  I would also fight for inclusion on the chess article. It's not that it's an implementation.  It is whether the link has advertising, special downloads, required log-ins. I also remind you that WP:EL is a guideline, not a policy, which implies we should err on the side of inclusion, particularly when the only argument you seem to have is a COI with an editor. <a href="/wiki/User:Bytebear" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bytebear" title="User talk:Bytebear">talk</a>) 05:15, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
<dl><dd>You keep using words like "fight" and "battle". Could we reframe this as a "discussion" instead? And accusing me of having a COI isn't helpful either. All the personal attack stuff is just distracting and irrelevant. (I've been called passive-aggressive, lonely, a censor, and a vandal now. I've also been accused of having a COI and of wanting to "punish" someone. None of this is relevant to why it's so critical to include links to those websites, even when their inclusion is disputed by numerous good faith editors. Surely they could be left out while the discussion is ongoing, anyway?)</dd>
<dd>EL is a guideline, sure. But consensus is a policy. When it comes to promoting other websites, we should err on the side of leaving them out unless there is a consensus to ignore those guidelines. Item #4 of the external links guideline is that links intended to promote a website should be avoided. Since these sites offer no information but a playable version of the game, I don't see how their inclusion in the article is critical. I don't see why someone would insist repeatedly that they should be included when there is a significant amount of opposition to their inclusion. (I also don't understand why you keep repeating that these links don't violate WP:EL, when item #4 on the links normally to be avoided has been pointed out over and over again.)</dd>
<dd>And even if that weren't the case, a consensus should exist that the links be included. "Not violating the EL guideline" is not a reason for inclusion. Lots of websites might not violate guideline; that doesn't mean that all (or any) of them should be included.  <a href="/wiki/User:Rray" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rray" title="User talk:Rray">talk</a>) 05:36, 26 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>For whatever it is worth, here is my two cents worth:  I think the links should stay.  They do no harm and provide a service/use for those reading the entry.  I agree that this whole thing should be reframed as a discussion or even argument rather than a fight, but some people seem interested only in having their own way and not in presenting points for others to weigh.  I'm sorry that folks have called Rray unpleasant names.  I would point out that the history page of this discussion shows that one poster (I won't use the username, but it is easily discovered there) deleted one poster's comments in a way that seems antithetical to the spirit and purpose of a discussion page.  Here's what I would propose:  let's leave the links in place for some reasonable period of time to see whether A) their number grows unreasonably, B) users/editors continue to object to their presence (and I mean those other than the folks whose disapproval has already been amply articulated here), and/or C) some piece of the sky falls.  How about if we just leave the links in place for, say, four months and at that time see whether feelings on both sides continue to run as strong and deep as they appear to do now?  Wouldn't that be better than what this has devolved into?  <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 15:14, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Doing no harm is not a reason to include the links, and being useful is not a reason to include the links. We err on the side of not including links in these situations.

<p>Rray's characterization of the "votes" on this matter as being a "huge majority" in favor of removing the links is simply not supported by "counting" the different users on each side of this question based on the comments on this page.  If we are not actually going to have a "vote" and "abide by" the results, can't we agree that the numbers on each side are irrevelant (or at least stop misrepresenting what they are)?? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 15:41, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

<dd>Enough of this already. Two more editors (Orangemike then DrNick) without a conflict of interest come to the discussion and note the links should go.  The clear majority of non COI editors oppose the links and/or recognize there is no consensus for having them.   Certainly no consensus exists to have them.  It's over.

<p>To 2005:  It is wildly wrong to assume that anyone who wants links is merely promoting a website.  This is absolutely unfounded.  To assert COI for anyone who supports the links basically boils down to an invalid ad hominem argument.  I count ONE user who has a tie to a website;  all the others make intellectual and logical arguments for their inclusion.  To Rray:  I went back through this discussion page and counted the unique users for and against and those for come out on top.  Anyone who wishes to do so can count them;  the only way Rray can be baffled is if Rray hasn't counted the users.  Rray is perhaps correct that "no harm" and "useful" are not valid arguments, but then ignores "real" arguments such as that providing the opportunity to play the game is a form of "experiential knowledge" not otherwise available in the article;  if Rray has a counter-argument to the "real" arguments in favor of keeping the links I for one would like to hear it as I am open to being convinced that my stance in favor of keeping them is wrong. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 15:51, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I don't necessarily agree with your reasoning behind why these links should be included, but a link to the DMOZ category, which lists several places where people can gain this "experiential knowledge", has the same outcome. Your reasoning does not explain why these three links should be included instead of a link to the appropriate DMOZ category, which is the suggested and common solution in this type of situation.</dd>
<dd>At this point, it really is time to move on to something else. I asked for neutral parties to weigh in from the administrators' noticeboard, and everyone who responded from there agreed that the links were inappropriate. The links don't comply with our external link guidelines, they provide little value, and they're not as useful as a single link to the DMOZ category, which lists literally dozens of sites which offer not only free-play games, but also additional useful information. <a href="/wiki/User:Rray" title="User:Rray">Rray</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rray" title="User talk:Rray">talk</a>) 16:09, 28 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl>

If Rray thinks DMOZ is an appropriate way to deal with the situation (I disagree because DMOZ is cumbersome and out of date), why doesn't Rray add such a link to the article??  Also, Rray points out (correctly) that neutral parties were asked to weigh in and "everyone who responded" agreed that the links should be removed.  That's somewhat misleading as "everyone" was just two people.  Even counting them, the "vote" is still in favor of retaining the links. If Rray really thinks it is time to move on, perhaps the way to express that most effectively is to leave the issue alone and stop reverting the page to versions which don't include the links???? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 16:18, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

I don't understand the urgency of including these links, and no one has offered a valid reason why these links are critical to include here. DMOZ being "cumbersome and out of date" is inaccurate, unexplained, and irrelevant. The links there work and they're on topic, so it's a perfectly reasonable compromise.

<p>I am, frankly, REALLY tired of both 2005 and now Rray asserting or implying that anyone who supports the links must be promoting a website.  No evidence of such is offered and thus the comment seems merely intended to discredit an arguer rather than to refute the argument.  I note that nasty comments seem to have "shut up" several posters above during the discussion and that is a shame.  Rray's statement above that "no one has offered a valid reason why these links are critical to include here" is off-base in several ways.  Arguments have repeatedly been offered above;  the fact that Rray doesn't argree with them doesn't render them invalid.  Also, I think most Wikipedia articles include material which could not fairly be described as "critical," so criticality seems to be a red-herring here.  If Rray thinks that DMOZ is not cumbersome, I invite Rray to try to add something there and then report back here on how it went!  I've read the material on consensus, thank you, and it just doesn't seem to apply here where the long, detailed, sometimes heated discussion indicates that there is no consensus.  I also am tired of people saying it is "time to end this discussion" ONLY when their particular view of the subject is prevailing on the article.   I frankly don't understand why a number of good folks are so incensed about the links.  No one is ever forced to use them, but those who want them cannot use them if they are deleted!  If the discussion must continue, then, that's OK, but it should continue with the links still in place until consensus is achieved. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 16:39, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sembiance has already said he owns one of the sites.  Your single purpose contributions suggest you are either him, or also have the same conflict of interest.  Except for Bytebear, you and the two others supporting inclusion of these links have less than 30 edits that are not adding external links to Solitaire articles, while the nine or so people opposing the links have well over <b>30 THOUSAND</b>.

<p>Again, I point out that 2005 for the fifth time refuses to accept the comments of others as being offered in good faith as Wikipedia rules require.  I recognize that Sembiance acknowledges ownership of a site and has a COI.  I hope 2005 will take me at my word that I am neither Sembiance nor have a website involved in this matter.  It is certainly revealing that 2005 wants his opponents to move on with their lives only when his/her viewpoint is currently holding the floor but refuses to move on with his/her own life when the other side is predominating.  I repeat:  I am not Sembiance and have no website in the matter.  If 2005 were correct, then Sembiance is logging on both by alternate usernames and from geographically widely separated IP addresses:  I ran the numbers and one poster is from an IP address in Myrtle Beach South Carolina and I'm posting from Ontario in Canada.  Maybe Sembiance should be starring in the new movie Jumpers??? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86" title="Special:Contributions/216.13.88.86">216.13.88.86</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:216.13.88.86" title="User talk:216.13.88.86">talk</a>) 16:39, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Because not everybody will agree what the link should be, and COI editors could push an agenda.  It makes no sense to choose a single individual link.

<p>Once again 2005 assumes COI in the case of anyone who supports having links.  This is a clear violation of Wikipedia rules (and 2005 is eager strictly to apply a mere guideline, but feels free to ignore an actual rule).  I think a small number (less than 10, say) of links is perfectly appropriate;  such links are to be found (without controversy of any kind) on other articles about games.  Indeed, if one takes pages on celebrities or musicians to be an appropriate parallel, most of them I randomly checked have links to what are in fact commercial websites and no one seems to care.  If 2005 is right and people don't agree, well, people seem not to agree on issues on other Wikipedia pages and no disaster has occurred.  Why can't the links here just be left alone as they are on these other pages? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 14:47, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

<p>But the goalposts keep changing.  Just above 2005 says the reason not to have links is that not everyone agrees to which links should be in place and that folks with COI would push an agenda.  2005 makes no mention of the objections of editors.  What is really the standard and why can't it be applied consistently across Wikipedia?? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67" title="Special:Contributions/206.74.61.67">206.74.61.67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:206.74.61.67" title="User talk:206.74.61.67">talk</a>) 15:10, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

<p>I modified the theoretical high score to be 1256 based on the game setup and scoring formulae reported in the article which I confirmed by game play.  A total of 800 points are added to the initial 500 for a complete game.  Not fewer than 44 moves are required to complete a game because, at the start, there are 44 cards to turn over and one move is required to turn over each.  The question is then whether it is possible to construct a game that can be completed within 44 moves.  Since the Windows version does not require that moves be exhausted or even that a move be made between the seven hands of the game, it seems obvious that there are multiple deals that could result in only 44 moves.  Whether that is true or not, 1256 is a better value than 1300 since it reflects a known lower limit to the number of moves.--<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:WikeJEC&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:WikeJEC (page does not exist)">WikeJEC</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WikeJEC&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:WikeJEC (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:02, 4 May 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>There's a known bug in which the user sometimes gets 100 points for clearing a suit, then uses undo and does not lose the 100 points... thereby giving the user the ability to get an "impossible" score.

I wonder: was 186.136.162.129 who had the score of 1363 playing a different version, or is there another "undocumented feature" besides the one 98.71.104.64 described?</dd>
<dd>The article mentioned "a theoretical maximum of 1254 points" together with "A bonus of 100 points is gained for completing 4 sets of the same colour", which are both misleading; I've never seen that particular bonus in any of the games I've played, so I removed that part.<a href="/wiki/User:Twistlethrop" title="User:Twistlethrop">Twistlethrop</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Twistlethrop" title="User talk:Twistlethrop">talk</a>) 07:24, 2 December 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>Can anybody suggest why the theoretical maximum score for the Windows version was changed from 1256 (as above) to the (apparently) unjustified value of 1280 (by anonymous user 112.141.133.11 at 09:58 on 9 December 2018)&#160;?
Each of the 44 face-down cards MUST be turned, either by moving the card on top of it or by getting a completed suit removed from just on top of it.
To me this means an absolute minimum of 44-7 = 37 moves, which (if feasible) would lead to a score of 1263. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Heraldica&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Heraldica (page does not exist)">Heraldica</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Heraldica" title="User talk:Heraldica">talk</a>) 12:58, 15 December 2019 (UTC)

<p>Am I missing something here? For Spider Layout it says "The Tableau consists of 10 stacks with 6 cards in each stack with the 6th card face up."

<p>The article states that the game originates in 1947 and it also states at the same time that it was FDR's favorite solitaire game. FDR, as we know, died in 1945. How can a game be someone's favorite if the game is invented only after this person's death? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2001:14BA:9F01:EA0C:0:0:0:1" title="Special:Contributions/2001:14BA:9F01:EA0C:0:0:0:1">2001:14BA:9F01:EA0C:0:0:0:1</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2001:14BA:9F01:EA0C:0:0:0:1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2001:14BA:9F01:EA0C:0:0:0:1 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:52, 4 January 2021 (UTC)

<p>The linked source says Spider (solitaire) was invented in 1949, and that it was a favorite of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. However amazing people might think FDR was, I find it hard to believe he played a game invented after he was dead. (If somebody has a reliable source that clears up this contradiction, feel free to fix it.)
</p><p>As I found the online source which said it was invented in 1949 (the article previously had the date as 1947 which conflicts with the source as it is currently), I removed the following (you can see the full editing in the source editing):
