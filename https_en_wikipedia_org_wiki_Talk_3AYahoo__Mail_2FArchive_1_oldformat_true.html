<p>Is the "mocha eval expression" filter thing true (anymore)?  I just tried it and no words were changed and no underscores were added.

<h2><span id="Is_this_too_POV.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_this_too_POV?">Is this too POV?</span></h2>
<p>I was about to add this to the page, but feel it may be a little too POV:
</p><p>When Yahoo increased their quota to 100mb, they also removed a couple of featurs that many users found useful:
</p>
<ul><li>Some older accounts had free <a href="/wiki/POP3" class="mw-redirect" title="POP3">POP3</a> access; this access was removed when the upgrade happened.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It used to be possible to write messages in raw HTML by clicking on a checkbox marked "this mail is in HTML".  After the upgrade, Internet Explorer is the only browser that allows people to write non-<a href="/wiki/ASCII" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> email messages, and even that no longer allows direct editing of HTML in emails.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I will concur with  the above user and add that this article really needs to updated to reflect previous "premium" e-mail services from Yahoo!.  Having used Yahoo mail since 2000 and subscribing to its premium services a year later, I recall a time when yahoo had about two-three additional plans of varying capacities, like 25MB, 50MB, and 100MB.  I will have to review my account information but I think I purchased the 25MB plan a few months before the "one-size-fits-all" 2GB plan.  Hopefully someone with a better memory or reputable source can add/elaborate on this.--<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Kevin586&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kevin586 (page does not exist)">Kenn Caesius</a> 21:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The comparison with <a href="/wiki/Gmail" title="Gmail">Gmail</a> is 95% biased. Yahoo Mail lacks lots of features that Gmail has. And Gmail uses <a href="/wiki/AJAX" class="mw-redirect" title="AJAX">AJAX</a> while Yahoo still not.

As a non-BETA Plus user of Yahoo’s e-mail services, implementation of unlimited storage for e-mail is most likely not going to happen this month and so the article should mention this delay.

<p>They WILL limit how much storage you can use.  The main thing that has changed is that the limits are now hidden -- there is now no way to find out how much you will be allowed to use, before they toss you out on your ear -- just like Netflix and cable and every other marketing department that thinks it is good to pretend to sell a fantasy.
</p><p>"What exactly does unlimited storage mean?<br />
Unlimited storage gives normal email account users like yourself an opportunity to not have to worry about hitting a storage limit."

</p><p>Even weirder than pretending we get unlimited storage, they seem to have taken away from us any way to check on the total amount of storage that we ARE currently using.  So, none of us will know how much storage we are using -- and no one will actually know whether yahoo lets users store more or less email than other services!

</p><p>Since Yahoo! Mail adopted "unlimited" storage, I've noticed my paid account gets suspended once a week on average, blocking any mail sent to the address.  I suspect it occurs because I've surpassed some limit on message storage, but I have no way of knowing exactly when it will occur, thanks to the removal of the storage indicator.  Having a limit on unlimited storage that customers don't know about is false advertising; the main article should mention this issue.
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I would certainly discourage anyone from editing the article to accuse Yahoo of "false advertising." It is unlikely that the editor who wrote that would have any idea what the legal standard for false advertising is. (Hint: the Yahoo claim is almost certainly not false advertising.) In any event, it would clearly violate the NPOV mission of wikipedia.

</p><p>Unlimited does NOT mean "infinite".  Unlimited simply means they will have enough for everyone's needs, so they will not have to limit what anyone uses.  Of course there are actual limits, and if those limits are reached then they will have to reconsider their policy of unlimited e-mail.  But as long as they can supply all accounts with enough space to store what their users want to store, they can call it unlimited.  Given how fast they are expanding their servers, this is entirely possible.

</p><p>For the life of me, I can't remember where, but I know I read somewhere that Yahoo said they would provide unlimited storage, but anyone found to be using Yahoo Mail to store lots of files would have their accounts disabled/closed or their files deleted. Anyone else remember this? More importantly, anyone remember <i>where</i>? <a href="/wiki/User:Lx45803" title="User:Lx45803">Lx45803</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lx45803" title="User talk:Lx45803">talk</a>) 18:03, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
</p><p>Their terms of use clearly state that abuse will not be tolerated. So of course, the yahoo counterpart of GmailFS will probably never exist. I think most of you are confusing "Unlimited" with "Infinite", which of course are 2 different things. I mean, using the restaurant analogy, you can pay the nominal fee and start loading a truck with food from the buffet, just because there are unlimited servings. Read Chetblong's link. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Baka_toroi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Baka toroi (page does not exist)">Baka toroi</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Baka_toroi" title="User talk:Baka toroi">talk</a>) 18:14, 7 March 2008 (UTC)
</p><p>Unlimited means that they wont limit how much storage a person uses (unlimited can be subjective, as most people will only have firsts, seconds, and then desert in a all you can eat buffet)), and while they most certainly do have limits, they have not reached them yet. <a href="/wiki/User:Atomic1fire" title="User:Atomic1fire">Atomic1fire</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Atomic1fire" title="User talk:Atomic1fire">talk</a>) 23:08, 25 August 2008 (UTC)
</p><p>The allowed storage capacity CAN actually be unlimited. However due to other constraints this does not mean you can store an infinite amount of data right away. For example, if there is a limit of 10000 emails that you are allowed to store per month with a maximum size of 30MB, this means your mailbox can only grow with 300G per month before you exceed the fair use policy. Assuming that not too many people do this yahoo just needs to extend it's total storage capacity a little bit due to this each month. They will easily manage this as long as other people behave less extreme and therefore the storage capacity will never be a binding constraint. Hence, the capacity can be called unlimited while it simultaneously is not possible to fill infinite storage within a limited amount of time.
Having said all this, I wonder whether anyone has actually met problems which seem to imply some kind of storage limit? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:MathEtc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:MathEtc (page does not exist)">MathEtc</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MathEtc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:MathEtc (page does not exist)">talk</a>)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Failure_to_sync_Yahoo_mail_with_Blackberry">Failure to sync Yahoo mail with Blackberry</span></h2>
<p>There is no mention in this article of Yahoo mail no longer syncing with users' Blackberry handhelds, which began occurring in June 2010. Here is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Internet-Service/Yahoo-email-no-longer-syncs-read-status/m-p/530028#M6963">link</a> to current discussion forums at Research In Motion's Blackberry support forums. As of this discussion it is not possible to use two-way synchronization, meaning that deleting an e-mail from one's Yahoo account via computer no longer deletes the same e-mail from one's Blackberry. The result is that you have to delete the same e-mail twice - once from the Yahoo account and then again from your Blackberry. RIM, the manufacturer of Blackberry, has stated on the forums that the problem is on Yahoo's side. Yahoo states they are working to resolve the problem and expect a solution by end of July 2010.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/76.242.22.78" title="Special:Contributions/76.242.22.78">76.242.22.78</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:76.242.22.78&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:76.242.22.78 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:18, 24 June 2010 (UTC)</span>

In conversations with Yahoo customer service personnel they seemed to not fully grasp the importance of this, as they claimed their standard was better than what is in the Requests for Comments governing abuse and spam reporting and required email addresses and requirements for those email addresses.  The standard is 'abuse at example.com' for every domain that has an MX record and/or mail exchanger.  This is required by the 'Invariants' clause in RFC 2142.

<p>From user experience.
</p><p>After Yahoo got the Captcha technology from Carnegie Mellon University, problems surfaced for a few users, including excessive display of Captcha images, obscene words or letter strings that looked like obscene words or phrases such as the 'AH FFKK' display in one Captcha that I saw.  Yahoo and CMU did take action, so in the years since this occurred, the problem has never reoccurred with obscenity.
</p><p>As to the appearance of Captchas themselves, they only appear for some people when trying to report spam both to outside providers and to Yahoo given that Yahoo doesn't read spam reports from a clickable report button like Gmail supposedly does, and users who have had this issue have reported no disposition of the issue when raised with Yahoo Mail itself.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.57.84.205" title="Special:Contributions/70.57.84.205">70.57.84.205</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.57.84.205&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:70.57.84.205 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:59, 18 February 2009 (UTC)</span>

<dl><dd>In my opinion you have to be looking for obscenity to see it in "AH FFKK". It is just a random string of letters. I don't see what they should be expected to do except make sure they are not in the dictionary. How would you suggest they filter things like "FKMA AS"?

<p>I do agree partly on this, as yes, you can make something good or bad from anything.  Take for example an urban legend in Utah regarding the original name of a building on the BYU Campus.  It said that the building was to be known as the 'Faculty and Research Tower' and you guessed it, the acronym (BYU uses them a lot) would have been 'FART'.  Well, allegedly someone spotted this, so it was back to the drawing boards supposedly, and the name was then decided on to be the 'Spencer W. Kimball Tower', with the acronym SWKT.
</p><p>But the AH FFKK is more than obvious to many, and you may still disagree on the rest, or even that, and that is how I was able to get CMU to work through being sure that obvious things that actually spelled words or were very near enough to be considered such in shortened or altered forms would be filtered out instead of put up when you got a captcha.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/174.23.141.249" title="Special:Contributions/174.23.141.249">174.23.141.249</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:174.23.141.249" title="User talk:174.23.141.249">talk</a>) 00:39, 13 April 2011 (UTC)</span>

However if people don’t agree that this is is the whole story, perhaps we can just word it something like “Some people [refer to them] have been able to use it without the special ID command or special programs”?

</p><p>On the Bugzilla thread that you mention, a company representative from Yahoo! (specifically the Yahoo Mail program manager) clearly states that they do not support accessing Yahoo Mail through IMAP on the desktop.  From the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=493064">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=493064</a> bug:
</p><p>Hi all, 
</p><p>I'm the PM for the Yahoo! Mail Platform and I wanted to drop a note on this thread (which David Ascher pointed me to).  Yahoo is working with Mozilla to bring IMAP access to Thunderbird but we are not prepared for this currently.  We will not support users that access IMAP from the desktop today.  This being said we are actively pursuing an open IMAP solution and have started by piloting for mobile.
</p><p>Thanks much

<dl><dd>I have no big problems with saying Yahoo supports IMAP use from mobiles but not from desktops, although a better source than the Bugzilla post would be nice. (All I could find was what is implied by <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/mail#imap">http://mobile.yahoo.com/mail#imap</a>.)</dd>
<dd> My only real problem is the accuracy of the claim that “the servers deny login unless the client provides a specific IMAP user agent identification command” (as it currently reads). I thought the Bugzilla thread would be reasonable evidence that this was not always the case, and I have tried to reword it to say so. Do you have a problem with that change in particular, or just something else that I was changing at the same time? <a href="/wiki/User:Vadmium" title="User:Vadmium">Vadmium</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vadmium" title="User talk:Vadmium">talk</a>) 06:39, 28 August 2011 (UTC).</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mail_deletion_policy">Mail deletion policy</span></h2>
<p>I was surprised to find last night that all my mail and contacts from the past 13 years had been deleted because I had not logged in for four months. Further, to avoid this happening again, Yahoo insists on an upgrade to a paid service. Does anyone know when this policy was set up, and whether it's worth mentioning in the article?
