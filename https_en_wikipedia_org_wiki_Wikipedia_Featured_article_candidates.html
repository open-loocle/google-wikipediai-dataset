<p>Here, we determine which articles are to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles (FAs)</a>. FAs exemplify Wikipedia's very best work and satisfy the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">FA criteria</a>. <b>All editors are welcome to review nominations</b>; please see the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches">review FAQ</a>.
</p><p>Before nominating an article, nominators may wish to receive feedback by listing it at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Peer review</a>. Editors considering their first nomination, and any subsequent nomination before their first FA promotion, are <b>strongly advised</b> to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Mentoring_for_FAC" title="Wikipedia:Mentoring for FAC">seek the involvement of a mentor</a>, to assist in the preparation and processing of the nomination. Nominators must be sufficiently familiar with the subject matter and sources to deal with objections during the featured article candidates (FAC) process. Nominators who are not <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo">significant contributors to the article</a> should consult regular editors of the article before nominating it. Nominators are expected to respond positively to constructive criticism and to make efforts to address objections promptly.  An article should not be on Featured article candidates and Peer review or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GAN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GAN">Good article nominations</a> at the same time.
</p><p>The FAC coordinators—<a href="/wiki/User:Ian_Rose" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Ealdgyth" title="User:Ealdgyth">Ealdgyth</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a>—determine the timing of the process for each nomination. For a nomination to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/September_2021" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/September 2021">promoted</a> to FA status, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> must be reached that it meets the criteria. Consensus is built among reviewers and nominators; the coordinators determine whether there is consensus. A nomination will be removed from the list and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Archived_nominations/September_2021" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Archived nominations/September 2021">archived</a> if, in the judgment of the coordinators:
</p>
<ul><li>actionable objections have not been resolved;</li>
<li>consensus for promotion has not been reached;</li>
<li>insufficient information has been provided by reviewers to judge whether the criteria have been met; or</li>
<li>a nomination is unprepared, after at least one reviewer has suggested it be withdrawn.</li></ul>
<p>It is assumed that all nominations have good qualities; this is why the main thrust of the process is to generate and resolve <i>critical</i> comments in relation to the criteria, and why such resolution is given considerably more weight than declarations of support.
</p><p>Please do not use graphics or templates on FAC nomination pages.  Graphics such as <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/18px-Yes_check.svg.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/27px-Yes_check.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/36px-Yes_check.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="600" data-file-height="600" />&#160;<b>Done</b></span> and <img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/18px-X_mark.svg.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="21" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/27px-X_mark.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/36px-X_mark.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="525" data-file-height="600" /> <b>Not done</b> slow down the page load time, and complex templates can lead to errors in the FAC archives.  The only templates that are acceptable are &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Xt" title="Template:Xt">xt</a>&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:!xt" title="Template:!xt">!xt</a>&#125;&#125;, and &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Tq" class="mw-redirect" title="Template:Tq">tq</a>&#125;&#125;; templates such as &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Green" title="Template:Green">green</a>&#125;&#125; that apply colours to text and are used to highlight examples; and &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Collapse_top" title="Template:Collapse top">collapse top</a>&#125;&#125; and &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Collapse_bottom" title="Template:Collapse bottom">collapse bottom</a>&#125;&#125;, used to hide offtopic discussions.
</p><p>An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only one article at a time, but two nominations may be allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them. If a nomination is archived, the nominator(s) should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating. None of the nominators may nominate or co-nominate any article for two weeks unless given leave to do so by a coordinator; if such an article is nominated without asking for leave, a coordinator will decide whether to remove it. A coordinator may exempt from this restriction an archived nomination that attracted no (or minimal) feedback.
</p><p>Nominations in urgent need of review are listed <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/FAC_urgents" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/FAC urgents">here</a>.  To contact the FAC coordinators, please leave a message on the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">FAC talk page</a>, or use the &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:@FAC" title="Template:@FAC">@FAC</a>&#125;&#125; <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notifications" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Notifications">notification</a> template elsewhere.
</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/archiving" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/archiving">bot will update the article talk page</a> after the article is promoted or the nomination archived; the delay in bot processing can range from minutes to several days, and the <code>{{FAC}}</code> template should remain on the talk page until the bot updates <span class="nowrap"><code>{{Article history}}</code></span>.

<ul><li>To respond to a nomination, click the "Edit" link to the right of the article nomination (not the "Edit this page" link for the <i>whole</i> FAC page).   All editors are welcome to review nominations; see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches">the review FAQ</a> for an overview of the review process.</li>
<li>To support a nomination, write *'''Support''', <b>followed</b> by your reason(s), which should be based on a full reading of the text. If you have been a significant contributor to the article before its nomination, please indicate this. A reviewer who specializes in certain areas of the FA criteria should indicate whether the support is applicable to all of the criteria.</li>
<li>To oppose a nomination, write *'''Object''' or *'''Oppose''', <b>followed</b> by your reason(s). Each objection must provide <b>a specific rationale that can be addressed</b>. If nothing can be done in principle to address the objection, a coordinator may disregard it. References on style and grammar do not always agree; if a contributor cites support for a certain style in a standard reference work or other authoritative source, reviewers should consider accepting it. Reviewers who object are strongly encouraged to return after a few days to check whether their objection has been addressed. To withdraw the objection, strike it out (with <code>&lt;s&gt; ... &lt;/s&gt;</code>) rather than removing it. Alternatively, reviewers may transfer lengthy, resolved commentary to the FAC archive talk page, leaving a link in a note on the FAC archive.</li>
<li>To provide constructive input on a nomination without specifically supporting or objecting, write *'''Comment''' followed by your advice.</li>
<li><span class="anchor" id="subsection"></span><span class="anchor" id="semicolon"></span>For ease of editing, a reviewer who enters lengthy commentary may create a neutral <i>fourth-level</i> subsection, named either ==== Review by EditorX ==== or  ==== Comments by EditorX ==== (do <i>not</i> use third-level or higher section headers). Please do not create subsections for short statements of support or opposition—for these a simple *'''Support''',*'''Oppose''', or *'''Comment''' followed by your statement of opinion, is sufficient. Please do not use a semicolon to bold a subheading; this creates <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ACCESS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ACCESS">accessibility</a> problems.</li>
<li><span class="anchor" id="below"></span>If a nominator feels that an Oppose has been addressed, they should say so, either after the reviewer's signature, or by interspersing their responses in the list provided by the reviewer. Per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TALK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TALK">talk page guidelines</a>, nominators should not cap, alter, strike, or add graphics to comments from other editors. If a nominator finds that an opposing reviewer is not returning to the nomination page to revisit improvements, this should be noted on the nomination page, with a diff to the reviewer's talk page showing the request to reconsider.</li></ul>

<p>Some of you may have seen the FAC for <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008_Final" title="UEFA Euro 2008 Final">UEFA Euro 2008 Final</a>, which is currently active but hopefully close to a successful completion. Well this article is about the tournament prior to that one, the 2004 edition of the European Championship, and it brought one of the greatest shocks in the history of football. Outsiders Greece, who had never won a game at a major tournament before, stormed through the tournament, beating hosts Portugal in the opening game and then seeing off the tournament-holders France in the quarter-final and the Czech Republic in the semi-final. In the final, they met Portugal again and, through a combination of resolute defending and nicking a goal from a corner, they managed to overcome Portugal in their own back yard for a second time to claim the trophy. As ever, all comments and feedback welcome and I look forward to hearing from you. &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 08:55, 9 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>This is the latest of my FAC submissions about later Anglo-Saxon kings. Edmund I (939 to 946) was the first king to inherit the throne of all England, but he had to fight hard to keep his inheritance against Viking kings from Dublin who crossed the Irish Sea to become kings of York. He was successful in recovering northern England, but he died young trying to rescue a servant from an attack by a violent thief.

<li><b>Support</b>. Like Mike, I peer reviewed the article and my (very minor) quibbles were completely dealt with then. I am inexpert in Anglo-Saxon history, but to my layman's eye the article is convincingly comprehensive, balanced and well and widely sourced. It is beautifully written and splendidly illustrated. Meets all the FA criteria in my view. I'm happy to do a source review if no more expert volunteer comes forward. <b><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><a href="/wiki/User:Tim_riley" title="User:Tim riley"><span style="color:# 660066">Tim riley</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tim_riley" title="User talk:Tim riley"><span style="color:#848484"> talk</span></a></span></b> 20:01, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Chief Justice Melville Fuller was, by all accounts, a competent administrator and a kind man, but he also ended up on the wrong side of some of the worst decisions that the U.S. Supreme Court has ever rendered. Leading a conservative court in an era of change, the mustachioed jurist struck down the federal income tax, endorsed racial segregation, and turned laissez-faire into a constitutional mandate. Needless to say, the legal academy hasn't looked too favorably upon his tenure: despite recent attempts to rehabilitate his reputation, Fuller remains inextricably linked with what one scholar called "a far-off and bygone judicial age". Yet that age – one in which an increasingly conservative judiciary faced off against an increasingly progressive society – perhaps bears some similiarities to our own. The story of Melville Weston Fuller remains as relevant today as ever.

<p>This article is about... 
</p>
<ul><li>King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great), a monarch whose influence on European history has been substantial. His reign is seen as the exemplification of a rulership when early enlightenment ideology was pervasive. He is seen one of the key figures in the rise of Prussia, which eventually led to the rise of Germany. In addition, he is seen as unique because his individual characteristics are seen as putting a stamp on how Prussia, and to a lesser extent, Germany is seen to this day.</li>
<li>This page should be featured because it is one of the more visible on Wikipedia, averaging 1,800 page views/day. Thus, it would serve the Wikipedia community to ensure that this oft-viewed article displays the best Wikipedia has to offer.</li>
<li>Status as a Featured Article would also provide guidance for the article's future evolution. In the past two decades, it has also been a relatively controversial page, with many different interests and perspectives on Frederick being negotiated and renegotiated, with issues previously causing the article to become diffuse with inordinate focus on one aspect of Frederick II's life.  In the last few months, it has reached a state of relative stability in terms of content. (You will see many recent edits.  But most are mine: the majority of those being focused on finding verifiable references for most of the points made by the various editors, aligning what is stated with the references, formatting, and prose editing attempting narrative unity.) As information about and perceptions of Frederick II continue to change and unfold, Featured Article status provides the suggested standard for future content editors to aim for, ensuring the article serves the greater community.</li>
<li>Though the process can be grueling, a Featured Article nomination- if appropriate- will help polish the article as well.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Your comment points out the inadequacy of the NYT article as reference.  It is a very short blog presented as a ditty with little context (and it is behind a paywall.)  I updated it with a German-language article from <i>Welt</i> that addresses the issue in context of a 2012 Potdam exhibit, which interviews the curator. The new reference addresses the legend and where it may have come from, and more importantly the focus of the citation more closely matches the point being supported in the Frederick article that Frederick promoted the use of the potato in Prussia. (I added a translation of relevant sentences in the citation.) <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wtfiv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wtfiv (page does not exist)">Wtfiv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtfiv" title="User talk:Wtfiv">talk</a>) 18:53, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

I notice that the article cites several bachelors theses.

<dl><dd>These bachelor theses meet <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SCHOLARSHIP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SCHOLARSHIP">WP:SCHOLARSHIP</a> as peer-reviewed, secondary sources. Beyond functioning as citations that support a point made in the Frederick article, each focuses in depth on an issue that is often addressed by one sentence in the article.  The theses are reviewed by their academic advisors from established universities, approved by the university who publically maintains them on their website, and each article has elaborate references within them to support their argumentation.  Most importantly, functioning as references each is fully accessible to the interested reader, who can read them as further reading to explore the topic the theses address in depth, and allowing readers to evaluate and verify the quality and interpretation of the sources for themselves. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wtfiv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wtfiv (page does not exist)">Wtfiv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtfiv" title="User talk:Wtfiv">talk</a>) 18:53, 6 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Supervisor review of Bachelor theses is not technically a peer review. And what does indicate that these have been reviewed in the first place? They surely have been evaluated in their final form by the advisors, but that does not necessarily mean they also have been corrected prior publication. A university is usually required to publish all theses at least in their local libraries, so their published state does not necessarily say much about their quality. One indication for their importance would be their citation count: If they are widely cited, they are certainly considered important contributions to the field. However, at least the "The Invention of Frederick the Great" thesis does not have any citation at all, according to Google Scholar. I would recommend to replace them with better sources. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jens_Lallensack" title="User:Jens Lallensack">Jens Lallensack</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jens_Lallensack" title="User talk:Jens Lallensack">talk</a>) 19:11, 6 September 2021 (UTC)18:53, 6 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I agree that they are not on par with peer-review journals, and in a sense, students are not peers, but mentees.  So my intention is to imply they have been vetted by professionals in the field.  These theses have been approved as meeting requirements in their field.  I would agree that they do not have a high citation count, but I would like to suggest that many of these articles make their point using academic standards- particularly adequately documenting their case with academic citation. This can be directly verified by accessing the articles via one or two clicks. (as they can be accessed) with additional citations.</dd>
<dd>Over the years, this article has collected a wide variety of citations from a wide variety of sources.  Many of variable quality, and a goodly number are not academic at all.  I would suggest that these theses are strong in their own right and are available to the reader to make her or his own evaluation of the sources and had to meet a minimum academic standard. For example, if these sources were replaced, they may end up being replaced by works by professional biographers, which are often have a weaker standard of verification. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wtfiv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wtfiv (page does not exist)">Wtfiv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtfiv" title="User talk:Wtfiv">talk</a>) 19:30, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I will certainly get rid of the Theses if that is the consensus.
<ul><li>Curry's (2019) and Munn's (2019) detailed analyses of the changing perceptions of Frederick in postwar-Germany can replaced with a citation from Clark (2006), who has a few sentences scattered in his text in his treatment of post-war Brandenburg.</li>
<li>Weeds' (2015) detailed analysis of the Hohenzollern claims can be replaced by one of the standard biographers such as Asprey, MacDonogh, or Gooch, an older source that they used, such as Carlyle or Kruger.  Each has a sentence or two that should serve as a citation for the point made.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>From my perspective, I feel it is a loss to lose the opportunity to allow a reader to explore the implications of those single sentences in the article in more detail. (Perhaps a compromise would be to have a standard biographical source with a single line, and allow these sources to stand as a backup reference.  That way their materials- particularly their treatment of the details and additional sources- don't get lost.) <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Wtfiv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wtfiv (page does not exist)">Wtfiv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtfiv" title="User talk:Wtfiv">talk</a>) 20:01, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Me must understand that a Bachelor thesis is an exam. If it was approved by the supervisor, it just means the student did not fail. Bachelor theses can be very good, but are not necessarily so. For us here, this is very difficult to evaluate, that's why we need to rely on external indicators such as publisher credibility. But that is not really possible here.</dd>
<dd>The question is also: If they are not being cited by the academic community, why are they relevant? A reader would expect to see the key sources cited, the most widely established ones, rather than marginal ones like these.</dd>
<dd>If they can be replaced, I think that would be the best way to go.

<p>Just booking my place for now. Back with substantive comments later, but meanwhile two points of spelling caught my eye on a first skim through: Robert Citino spells the word "maneuvring" thus and not "manovering" as you have him say, and "unharmonious" seems odd: the OED gives no instances of the use of the word after 1876, and "inharmonious" is the usual modern form, I think. More anon.

<p>I reviewed the article for GA, and it is a pleasure to see it again. It seems to me admirably proportioned, balanced, well written, and splendidly illustrated. A few minor quibbles and suggestions for bringing the article from GA to FA standard:
</p>
<ul><li>Info-box</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Is "Calvinist" quite right for "Religion" in the info-box? Something like "Agnostic Christian" seems more the mark – or possibly omit the "Religion" line altogether? I just mention the point and am not sure about it. Pray ponder.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>I agree.  I left this as is, trying to respect the editors' choice.  I figured it worked as his baptised religion, though his work makes it clear that the greatest degree of religion he has is a kind of deism. His baptism is mentioned in the text and his more cynical attitudes toward religion are too, so I'll delete.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Lead</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>In the third paragraph <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">"Frederick was… Frederick also… Frederick was… Frederick is…".</span> – The prose would flow more smoothly with fewer "Frederick"s and more "he"s.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Done.  Three "Fredericks" are now "He's".</dd>
<dd>The rhythm of sentence subject reference now works like a kind of waltz meter: Frederick...He....He...;Frederick...(subordinate clause he)...he; Frederick...He....(subordinate clause he)...He...Frederick.  Kept "Frederick" for claim about homosexuality- it fell into the pattern anyway- as ensuring this is clearly stated has been a ongoing issue with this article for years and a recent commentator on the talk page wanted to ensure that this fact was not easily missed by readers.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Early life</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Frederick and Wilhelmine formed a close relationship at this time</span> – do we need the last three words?</li></ul>
<dl><dd>deleted</dd>
<dd>Thanks! "At this time", though emphasizing when the relationship was formed, undermines that fact that it was life long. Her death was one of the few times that the older Frederick (as opposed to the younger Frederick) was caught crying.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Katte affair</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Soon after his affair with Keith</span> – but you've just said we don't know if they had an affair. Safer to say something like "Soon after his relationship with Keith ended…"</li></ul>
<dl><dd>done</dd>
<dd>This is an artifact of editor's concern about Frederick's sexuality.  An editor chose "affair", as it too can have neutral connotations, but it does connote too much, given that- as with all things related to Frederick's sexuality, it remains murky.  "Relationship" is a clearly more neutral word in this case and distinguishes it from the "Katte affair", in which "affair" has a different definition and set of conotations altogether.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>War of the Austrian Succession</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>There Are An Awful Lot of Capital Letters in your caption to the excellent map of Frederick's battles.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Fixed</dd>
<dd>I'm glad you like it!  The map was a recent addition by an editor who added it to many Frederick II related articles.  I requested the editor to make minor changes and I made a few.  The title capitalization was my doing, however.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Seven Years' War</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Frederick forcibly incorporated … brought Frederick … also provided Frederick</span> – another lot of Fredericks that might advantageously be leavened with a "him" or two.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>done</dd>
<dd>three or for replacements, maintaining the analogical waltz rhythm.</dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">a Prussian title from Frederick, which Frederick naturally obliged</span> – is there a "with" missing before "which"? And there is possibly a hint of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EDITORIAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EDITORIAL">WP:EDITORIAL</a> about the "naturally".</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Fixed</dd>
<dd>I think this may have been an artifact of an editor who was focused in ensuring readers knew that Peter II was Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Most of the artifact of this extended focus was removed, but I think you caught the remainder.  Thanks!</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>It might be safest to redraw on the lines of "…a Prussian title; Frederick obliged", which has the incidental advantage of being shorter.
</p>
<ul><li>First Partition of Poland</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Poland was vulnerable to partition due to poor governance, in part due to the interference of foreign powers</span> – two "due to"s in a row. And I'm not entirely clear whether the foreign interference was the part cause of the vulnerability or of the poor governance.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>replaced the second <span class="example deprecated-content example-bad" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #8B0000;">due to</span> with <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">as well as</span></dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">an enlightened civilizing mission that emphasized … barbaric and uncivilized</span> – sudden outbreak of "ize" endings instead of the "ise" form elsewhere in the article. Better to be consistent.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Fixed</dd>
<dd>Most certainly this was my edit. Probably in response to helping address an editor's concern to ensure that Frederick II's impact on the people of Polish Prussia was acknowledged. (The consensus of the editors in this article to use British English is training me to be more careful, but lapses are my hallmark.)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Administrative modernisation</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">fixing rates that depreciated coins would be accepted</span> – seems to need "at which" rather than "that"</li></ul>

<dl><dd>"However" deleted</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>"civil service" deleted</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Religion</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Roman Catholic Church's goods and property</span> – it's been the ungeographical Catholic Church up to now, and I wonder if we need the "Roman" here.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>updated "Roman Catholic" throughout article.  Out of 13 occurrences of "Catholic; six are "Roman Catholic".</dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Frederick's religious views were sometimes the subject of criticism</span> – rather a long-winded way of saying they were sometimes criticised.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Fixed.  (Those American-trained editors with their orthographical lapses!)</dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Oderbruch marsh-land</span> – the OED doesn't hyphenate "marshland".</li></ul>
<dl><dd>fixed.</dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">He was also close to nature and issued decrees to protect plants.</span> – this doesn't altogether square with your statement, just above, that he considered nature in its wild form "useless".</li></ul>
<dl><dd>The art of combining two editorial views (Frederick enlightenment exploiter vs. Frederick enlightened animal-lover).  As the Blackbourn (2006) citation refers to land, I made the following change: <span class="example deprecated-content example-bad" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #8B0000;">"taming and "conquering" of nature...which, in its wild form, was considered "useless"</span> to <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">"taming" and "conquering" of nature...considering uncultivated land "useless"</span>. I believe this captures the sense of Blackbourn's (2006) point, which is focused on draining swamps, not the flora.  Then, it no longer contradicts the point you mentioned, which is supported by Das Gupta (2013). Das Gupta is focused on tamed animals, and mentions legislation in passing, though the focus is on "cultivated" plants like cherries and melons.  Does that work?  If not, I'll keep at it.

A few gave pause for some more thought on the issues in the article, which I appreciate more.

<dd><s>I haven't addressed the duplicate blue links yet, as I'll research a tool to find them, which I'm sure exists.

<p>I leave those three small points with you, and am pleased to add my <b>support</b> for the promotion of the article to FA. Some of the sources are fairly vintage, but there are plenty of modern sources as well, and the facts of Frederick's life and reign are well documented. The references have a few ISBNs and OCLCs missing: arguably this falls foul of FA criterion 2c, and though equally arguably it doesn't, it would be as well to add them. They are not hard to find: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a> will oblige. The text of the article seems to me balanced, comprehensive (without excessive detail), well written and admirably illustrated. I enjoyed reviewing this article and look forward to seeing it on the front page in due course.
</p><p>I'm interested to see my excellent colleague Aza24's comments below, on the music. I agree that brevity would be the key here. Music was only a sideline, after all, and the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Music</i> polishes Frederick off in 83 words; in a general encylopaedia article like this one, that can probably be reduced a bit. The ODM's entry (ref: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199578108.001.0001/acref-9780199578108-e-3558">"Frederick the Great"</a>, <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Music</i>.

<p>I don't know that I'll do a full review, but given his strong connection to the music of the time, I thought I'd point out a few things. Relevant information on the points below can be found in these articles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000010176#omo-9781561592630-e-0000010176-div1-2">Grove 1</a>,<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000901691">Grove 2</a>, and potentially <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/907651">here</a>, though I've not looked closely at the latter. McCulloch (1995). "A lesson on the King of Prussia: a New Look at the Compositions of Frederick the Great" <i>German Life and Letters</i> <b>48</b>, seems a rather relevant article, though I cannot find access to it.
</p>
<ul><li>As far as I can tell, there is currently no information on his operatic contributions. In <a href="/wiki/Montezuma_(Graun)" title="Montezuma (Graun)"><i>Montezuma</i></a>, Frederick wrote the libretto, and it seems he had further (seemingly lesser) contributions to other Graun opera librettos</li>
<li>Graun seems to have included some arias by Frederick in his operas (Grove 2)</li>
<li>A brief line should be included on the style of Frederick's music; though a political leader first and foremost, he wrote quite a bit of music. It seems that his operatic style was remarkably similar to <a href="/wiki/Carl_Heinrich_Graun" title="Carl Heinrich Graun">Carl Heinrich Graun</a>, and he did not venture far from the <a href="/wiki/Classical_period_(music)" title="Classical period (music)">classical approach</a> over a solo voice over a simple accompaniment (Grove 1/2). His works for flute seem influenced primarily be Quantz, who was also (a detail that might be added) his teacher (Grove 1).</li>
<li>The two editions of his musical works in Grove 1 should likely be added to the "Works by Frederick the Great" section</li>
<li>I'm not sure on the benefits on including the Recording of compositions by Frederick the Great section, particularly if only a single recording is listed</li>
<li>Though touched on earlier in the article, it might be added that Frederick's art patronage was a rather extreme contrast from his father. Though I haven't looked at the article thoroughly enough to see if this is already included.</li>
<li>Just to clarify, I do recognize this is a rather large article already—I imagine the above points can easily be addressed by no more than single sentence each, which I hope is acceptable. This is just a brief run through, I'll attempt to look closer later, but probably mostly at music related matters. <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 08:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I've done the easy bits (i.e. in this article, not on Commons). Do you have a suggestion what is best practice for dead source links? For the Rigaud painting and the Hodges paintings (and Forster's ice blink), I have other (online and offline) references that verify that these images are old and by these painters. If I add these, is that OK even if I don't know exactly where the .jpg is from? (They're not the source of the actual jpg data, but a source for the picture). This is definitely a worthwhile exercise because, for example, the original dead source link for the Rigaud painting was a random university website where it was probably used as an illustration, so thank you for pointing this out. The Forster pictures are less well published, I'll have to see whether I can prove more clearly they are indeed Forster's. There are data sources for the voyage map given at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cook_Three_Voyages_59.png" class="extiw" title="c:File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png">c:File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png</a>; I'll check with the uploader who is still active.<br /> The additional US tag for PD-old items was news to me (seems to have been introduced a few years ago), but I'll make sure the images get tagged correctly and will report back. Thanks a lot for looking at these! —<a href="/wiki/User:Kusma" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kusma" title="User talk:Kusma">talk</a>) 15:52, 5 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Fell into a little rabbit hole of learning about the history of File:Forsterundsohn.jpg. Uploader has added source for File:Cook'sSecondVoyage53.png. Hope these two are acceptable now.

<dl><dd>Will look in more detail once you've done that, but a quick response now: if the dead source links are appropriate sources, then an archived version (eg from archive.org) would be a good replacement. <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nikkimaria" title="User talk:Nikkimaria">talk</a>) 02:51, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>There are unfortunately no archived versions that I could find, so I have removed the Forster watercolours of birds as not properly sourced and replaced them by <a href="/wiki/File:Gallirallus_pacificus.jpg" title="File:Gallirallus pacificus.jpg">File:Gallirallus_pacificus.jpg</a>, the lead image from the FA <a href="/wiki/Tahiti_rail" title="Tahiti rail">Tahiti rail</a>. I've also replaced the Cape Town image by a <a href="/wiki/File:A_View_of_the_Cape_of_Good_Hope,_Taken_on_the_Spot,_from_on_Board_the_Resolution_Hodges_1772.jpg" title="File:A View of the Cape of Good Hope, Taken on the Spot, from on Board the Resolution Hodges 1772.jpg">File:A View of the Cape of Good Hope, Taken on the Spot, from on Board the Resolution Hodges 1772.jpg</a>, as there are claims that the previously used image was actually painted ten years later on a different journey (not a debate I want to cover here).</li>
<li>For everything that was missing a US tag, I have added one, together with the best information on the images and their publication history that I've been able to find (from the authoritative art book and catalogue Joppien, Rüdiger; Smith, Bernard (1985). The art of Captain Cook's voyages. 2. Melbourne: Oxford University Press in association with the Australian Academy of the Humanities. ISBN 978-0-19-554456-5).</li>
<li>File:Forsterundsohn.jpg has a higher-resolution but less bright version at the Australian National Portrait Gallery; I'd rather keep the current version if possible. It can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.berose.fr/article1807.html?lang=en">here</a> (which I've mentioned), but I think it is likely they copied it from Commons.</li>
<li>Should there be further copyright issues (unexpected PD-US/date of publication questions) with any of the images here, there are many alternative images that could be used to illustrate the content section. For example, ethnographic and other engravings from Cook's 1777 book or Forster's plant images from the 1775/76 <a href="/wiki/Characteres_generum_plantarum" title="Characteres generum plantarum">Characteres generum plantarum</a>. —<a href="/wiki/User:Kusma" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kusma" title="User talk:Kusma">talk</a>) 14:51, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay. There are some issues around publication for paintings - as per <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq-definitions.html">the definition of publication in US law</a>, simply being displayed does not constitute publication. So for example for File:Forsterundsohn.jpg, the information provided only confirms a publication date of 1976, not pre-1926. <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nikkimaria" title="User talk:Nikkimaria">talk</a>) 02:36, 8 September 2021 (UTC)

It's simple to the point of being hypnotic, but the visuals are gorgeous enough to bring me back again and again (the fountain! the palm tree escalator!). Amazingly, there was enough mainstream coverage to sail it past the bare minimum of the GNG and well into thoroughly-sourced territory, so here we are as a little palate cleanser between larger projects. (For anyone watching my FACs, yes, I do apparently love colorful minimalist indie games <a href="/wiki/Islanders_(video_game)" title="Islanders (video game)">with similar names</a>). &#9824;<a href="/wiki/User:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User:Premeditated Chaos">PMC</a>&#9824; <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User talk:Premeditated Chaos">(talk)</a> 06:19, 5 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>The article looks very good to me. I have honestly never heard of this game. To be completely honest, I do not think I agree with the <a href="/wiki/Non-place" title="Non-place">non-place</a> idea, but I think this is one of these cases where some people find value in it while others do not. My comments are relatively minor and nitpick-y. I hope this is helpful and have a great start to your week. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 01:23, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a>, thanks for your comments - always lovely to hear from you at FAC&#160;:) It's definitely an obscure game, even more so than <a href="/wiki/Islanders_(video_game)" title="Islanders (video game)">Islanders</a>, but I was just so taken with the art style I couldn't resist writing about it. &#9824;<a href="/wiki/User:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User:Premeditated Chaos">PMC</a>&#9824; <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User talk:Premeditated Chaos">(talk)</a> 02:13, 7 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><ul><li>Thank you for addressing everything. I really enjoyed reading the article and I always appreciate it whenever an editor brings an obscure topic through the FAC space. I also like the art style, from what I have seen so far, and it seems to compliment its gameplay very well. I <b>support</b> the FAC for promotion based on the prose.

<p>You have great taste in games&#160;:) This article looks quite sound, so I only have a few comments.
</p>
<ul><li>In the lead, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Many reviews drew comparisons to other minimalist art games</q> is a little obvious. Would the Nuovo Award nomination maybe be a better piece of information to stick in that spot? <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Sure</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>It's not quite clear what you mean by "anonymous" in the lead, as that term generally refers to people, not places. Would "nondescript" or something else perhaps be better? <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It can also mean bland or non-descript, and Merriam-Webster specifically uses a building as an example of this definition.
<dl><dd>I still think "non-descript" would be clearer, but it's your article, so I'll defer to your preference. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 22:41, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>The paragraph breaking in the lead could maybe be improved. The current break is between two sentences talking about the gameplay, which doesn't seem a logical place. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>My understanding is that most FA reviewers don't hold my view that templates used in FACs should be up to featured-level quality, so this isn't something I'll require you to address to earn my support, but I want to at least mention it, as readers are going to notice prose that isn't up to 1a standard just as much in the infobox as they would in the body. All of the instances of <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">(s)</q> in the infobox are unnecessary and distracting, as the values are all singular, so for this article, the labels ought to be, too. This is an issue I've been working on addressing at a broader level (see <a href="/wiki/Template_talk:Detect_singular#Override_function" title="Template talk:Detect singular">here</a>). <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yeah this is something we ran into at Inuit clothing as well. I don't have the patience nor the interest to go mucking with complicated templates like infoboxes that happen incidentally to be in my FACs, and to be honest I don't feel the (s) would that big of a deal for readers.
<dl><dd>No worries; it wouldn't be reasonable to expect you to dive into technical template areas. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 22:41, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>For the Turrell image, it's unfortunate that we don't have an actual good photo of a <a href="/wiki/Skyspace" title="Skyspace">skyspace</a> rather than just a rendering. The sparsity of Turrell photos is something I've encountered before—I wish ones like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.pomona.edu/museum/collections/james-turrell-skyspace#gallery-1">this</a> were public domain, but given the current available selection, I think the rendering is the right choice, and you've properly disclosed that it's a rendering in the caption. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I dunno, I like the current image. The unreal and monochromatic palette is quite similar to the visuals in the game; you can really see what Burton was drawing from.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>For <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">In an interview with Gamasutra</q>, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Speaking to Fast Company</q>, and <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Discussing the game's palette with Gamasutra</q>, I don't think it's necessary to provide in-text attribution. See the <i>Lancet</i> example at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:INTEXT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:INTEXT">WP:INTEXT</a>. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>INTEXT also says "In-text attribution should be used with direct speech", and all three of those are direct quotes from interviews.
<dl><dd>The way I interpret that is that it's important to attribute Burton when quoting him, but I'm sure how it helps the reader to also attribute the publication he's speaking to. A quote from him is still a quote from him, no matter who he says it to, and the publication is available in the reference for anyone who wants to check it out. This is a small point, though, so I won't let it hold me up from giving you my support below. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 22:41, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></dd></dl>

<ul><li>The reception section is missing &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Video_game_reviews" title="Template:Video game reviews">Video game reviews</a>&#125;&#125;.

<ul><li>For the refs 11, 17, and 18 (the three without bluelinked publishers), could you speak to why you found them reliable or noteworthy enough to warrant inclusion? Checking ja-WP for a possible ILL to <i>The Massage</i> is probably also worthwhile if you haven't already done so. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 21:59, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>In terms of "noteworthiness" I generally like to get as much opinion about a source in as I can. Particularly for gaming, where most sources are fairly positive, I want to get a breadth of criticism if I can find it. To that end, 148 Apps &amp; Twinfinite were both somewhat more critical than other reviews (although I realized that I forgot to put in 148's criticism - fixed now). Per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RSOPINION" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RSOPINION">WP:RSOPINION</a>, these kinds of sources are reliable for the purpose of giving their opinion, as long as it's clearly attributed in the article and not UNDUE, which I don't think it is here.

<p>Back in the mid-1980s, English football was at a low ebb: poor crowds, hooliganism etc.  Part of the solution was this new-fangled thing called the <a href="/wiki/English_Football_League_play-offs" title="English Football League play-offs">English Football League play-offs</a> which was essentially a postseason tournament for clubs who just missed out on <a href="/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation" title="Promotion and relegation">promotion and relegation</a>.  It was intended as a stop-gap method of balancing teams in the leagues, but more than 30 years later, we're still loving/hating/loving/hating it.  This particular article covers the play-off final for the <a href="/wiki/English_football_league_system" title="English football league system">third tier of English football</a> in that inaugural season of the play-offs, which was met with varied support.  Obviously, anyone who has won the play-offs loves it, and some of us who have lost in half a dozen, don't love it so much.  This FAC was brought to you as a co-nomination by me (an independent <a href="/wiki/Ipswich_Town_F.C." title="Ipswich Town F.C.">Tractor Boy</a>) and <a href="/wiki/User:ChrisTheDude" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Gillingham_F.C." title="Gillingham F.C.">Gill</a>), and both of us will work as hard as is required to cover any and all constructive concerns raised.

<p>This pyramid's unimpressive physical proportions – roughly 1:30th the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza – and ruined state, deterred much exploration until the turn of the 20th century. When Borchardt finally pulled it out of the desert, however, he discovered a quite remarkable pyramid complex. Spread across its walls were an estimated 10,000m2 of masterfully crafted relief art. Special mention must be made of a scene of Sahure hunting for the brutality of its imagery. Unfortunately, the relief is fragmented. Of the section presented in the article, I'd draw your attention to the bottom left where a horned herbivore has an arrow impaling its forehead while a hyena, equally speared, leaps at its throat. The quality of the artwork was such that for two millennia, pharaohs returned to copy the artwork for their own constructions... and to steal limestone, there was a lot of stone-thieving. Special thanks to Ceoil for their copy-editing, sorry for the prolonged delay [~ 2 years]. <a href="/wiki/User:Mr_rnddude" title="User:Mr rnddude">Mr rnddude</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mr_rnddude" title="User talk:Mr rnddude">talk</a>) 19:07, 2 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>Before I give the article a close perusal may I ask whether it is meant to be in English or American spelling? At present it is a mish-mash of the two, with "centre", "colour", "colourful", "metres", "mould", "sceptres" and "symbolising" in BrE and "centering", "equaled", "funneled", "gray", "program" and "skillfully" in AmE. Either is fine, but not a mixture of both. <b><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><a href="/wiki/User:Tim_riley" title="User:Tim riley"><span style="color:# 660066">Tim riley</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tim_riley" title="User talk:Tim riley"><span style="color:#848484"> talk</span></a></span></b> 09:36, 4 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>A solid article. I've made a lot of minor adjustments to the prose already, so as not to leave too many prose queries here; feel free to revert or adjust any you disagree with. Here are my remaining points about prose and content:
</p>
<ul><li>The passage in the lead about Borchardt's work is a little odd. "Properly" sounds somewhat opinionated, and I think of "seminal" as a work that reshapes a field of study, which I don't think Borchardt's work would qualify for unless it marked a major change in how pyramids in general were studied. You could simply use the same descriptors as in the body: "thoroughly" instead of "properly", and "standard" instead of "seminal".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yes, that works.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Farmed" for stone is unusual terminology; I've seen "quarried" used in this sense, but not "farmed". (When "farm" is used in a more metaphorical sense, it usually still has the meaning of cultivating something, which obviously isn't the case here.)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Although Verner calls it an obelisk, we don't actually know whether the <i>ben-ben</i> in Heliopolis was obelisk-shaped (e.g., Arnold 2003, p. 30, calls it "a pillar-like monument, having an irregular conical shape").</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I don't think the word 'obelisk' is vital to comprehending the sentence since the focus is on the pyramidion. So I've removed it.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>The section on the layout says "the main pyramids were dramatically reduced in size and adopted simplified construction techniques", as if that were one of the innovations introduced by Sahure's complex. But the chart in Lehner (p. 16) shows that Userkaf's pyramid was of similar size to Sahure's. I don't know if you can cite sources that say exactly this, but it seems that Userkaf established the modest size of Fifth Dynasty pyramids while Sahure's temple complex established the layout.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>The base length Sahure used [taken as 78.75 m] is fairly consistently used in later Old Kingdom pyramids as well, with the exception of Unas. Though the kings did favour a slightly taller build of 52.5 m. You are quite right to point out that Userkaf's is equally small. I've changed it to 'From the outset of the Fifth Dynasty ...' and added a cite pointing to Lehner's table.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The complex is the most expertly decorated and containing the most thematically diverse relief-work yet discovered from the Old Kingdom" — I'm not sure how to re-word it, but the clauses in this sentence don't quite fit together.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>You make a second comment about this later on, I've responded there.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"A stark departure from the Fourth Dynasty." is a sentence fragment, and it's not clear what aspect of the complex is a stark departure from the Fourth Dynasty.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Removed. I'll take a look at rewording the whole. <b>Note</b> - I've added a sentence at the end explaining the intent behind the enlarging of the storeroom complexes.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The pyramid had a, probably horizontally layered, core comprising six ascending steps, five of which remain." I think the passage about horizontal layers should be placed at the end, or even in a separate sentence clarifying its meaning (horizontally laid courses of stone).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Moved to own sentence.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I'm not sure of the purpose of the sentence about the size of the blocks in Neferefre's pyramid.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>The intent is to answer the potential 'how massive are these blocks?' question the reader may have, but that's only really possible from reference to Neferefre's pyramid. It didn't work within the sentence as it overburdened the reader. So I moved it to a lone sentence. It's not exactly a vital sentence to keep, so I can remove it if that would be better.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think it would be better to remove it.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Re: Asiatic vs. Asian, to Americans "Asian" tends to connote people from East Asia. "Near Eastern" seems to be the term most commonly used in Egyptology other than "Asiatic".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Changed. I settled for 'Near Eastern peoples' rather than 'Near Easterners' in a couple cases.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I pointed out in a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Unas/archive1" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Unas/archive1">previous FA nomination by Iry-Hor</a> that "<a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a>" is an anachronistic term, although Egyptologists sometimes use it; in that FAC it was replaced by "nomad" or "desert dweller".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Replaced with Nomads.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The architect Mark Lehner suggests that the corridor represented the untamed wild, surrounding a clearing – the open courtyard – of which the king was guarantor." Lehner is an Egyptologist, is he not? And "untamed wilderness", or perhaps even "natural world", would work better here than "wild".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yes, he is. I think I wanted to say archaeologist for variety and then bungled it and ended up saying architect.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>OK. There's still the slightly awkward use of "wild", though.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Source review</dt></dl>
<p>All sources look entirely solid, citing a wide variety of Egyptologists and including the most authoritative scholars on the subject (Borchardt, Arnold, Bárta, Edwards, Lehner, and especially Verner). There are a couple of oddities in the formatting, though:
</p>
<ul><li>Why is it necessary to specify the title of Bárta 2015 within the citations? I'd expect an unpaginated source to be cited by author and year alone.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Loc parameters emoved.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Arnold 2005 is a duplicate of Arnold 1997. Presumably 2005 is a reprint, but there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in pagination.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I only have access to the 1997 edition and the material is there on the same pages so I've just removed the 2005 version and changed the footnotes to 1997.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>I've also carried out 15 spot-checks and found no unambiguous errors, though I have a few that raised questions:
</p>
<ul><li>Citation 18c: Verner's text does say the diverse subject matter and artistic quality <i>together</i> make Sahure's reliefs "the highest level of the genre" from the Old Kingdom, but it doesn't quite say that the subject matter was the most diverse ever found.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I've modified the sentence and introduced Verner as a direct quote.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Citation 3h: The citation accurately reflects Lehner's text, but his measurements differ somewhat from Verner's (e.g., Lehner's slope of 50˚11′ 40′′ as opposed to the 50˚30′ in Verner 2001d, p. 463). It's particularly a problem because Lehner doesn't note the slightly off-square dimensions of the base, mentioned in the article's next sentence, which means the pyramid can't actually be 78.75 meters square. Verner gives 78.5 meters; in neither case do they specify whether they're measuring the longer or the shorter side. I don't know what to do about that problem.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>The obvious thing to do is to consult Borchardt (see. p. 27 of the 1910 source). He notes that the measurements are imprecise owing to the error but gives a length of 150 cubits / 78.75 metres [same as Lehner]&#160;; an angle of 50.5°, i.e. 50°30′, [Same as Verner]&#160;; and a height of 91 cubits / 48.31 metres [closer to Verner]. Borchardt's height has an error. 91 cubits is 47.75 m not 48.3 m, but 47.75 m mathematically matches the slope of 50.5 [47.765 so off by 1.5cm]. I can add a '~' in the infobox to denote an approximate measure. In the body this causes a complication. Borchardt is an older source so both Lehner and Verner would be preferred. Lehner/Borchardt have the same base measure&#160;; Verner/Borchardt have the same angle&#160;; nobody has the exact height [or Borchardt does if we accept his royal cubits measure and convert from that]. I would personally favour: base = 78.75 m, slope = 50°30′, height = 47.75 m. I could say something like: 'had an intended base of 78.75 m, converging at 50°30′ to a height of 47.75 m.' The next sentence would then explain why 'had an intended' rather than 'had'.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You might also list the range of figures given by the three sources.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Citation 161: I'm wondering why you render the priest's name as Ny-ku-re, as Scott 1952 does, rather than Ni-ka-re, as Allen 1999 does. I would expect a preference for the more recent of the two transcriptions.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I probably found it in Scott 1952 before Allen 1999. Changed to Nikare.</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>This article is about possibly one of the most polarising figures in modern British football, Craig Bellamy. A former captain of both the Welsh national side and Great Britain Olympic squad, he spent more than a decade in the Premier League with numerous teams.

</p><p><b>Quick comments</b> nobody outside of Britain knows what "gobbiest" means, I reckon. Also, there's absolutely nothing about his playing style in the lede. The Style of play section too, has only a perfunctory mention of his "quick, bursting technique and calmness under pressure" before an extended managerial back-and-forth about whether he had a bad attitude or not. There's needs to be more on his stocky stature, finishing ability, the positions he played etc. I haven't read most of the article but some of this stuff must be in the lede and in Style of play.—<a href="/wiki/User:Indopug" title="User:Indopug">indopug</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Indopug" title="User talk:Indopug">talk</a>) 11:01, 3 September 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Indopug" title="User:Indopug">Indopug</a>:</span>, thanks for taking a look. In regards to the gobbiest quote, Robson is one of the most noted British managers of the last 40 years, so his quote is more than suitable I would suggest and would be commonplace in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BRITENG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BRITENG">WP:BRITENG</a>. The style of play features more than you seem to imply I would say, several of the quotes mention his intensity and commitment on the pitch which was a key factor in his style of play. I've expanded further to provide more though as well. In regards to this being in the lede, this not a common thing in football articles, see FAs such as <a href="/wiki/Thierry_Henry" title="Thierry Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Bruce" title="Steve Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Beattie" title="Kevin Beattie">Kevin Beattie</a>, etc. The lede is generally used as a summary of the player's life and career. <a href="/wiki/User:Kosack" title="User:Kosack">Kosack</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kosack" title="User talk:Kosack">talk</a>) 12:30, 3 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks for providing those examples. <a href="/wiki/Thierry_Henry#Style_of_play" title="Thierry Henry">Thierry_Henry#Style_of_play</a> is actually exactly what I had mind with my comments above. Some things that impressed me in that article's section:
<ul><li>what position Henry played in and how it changed over time</li>
<li>the kind of goals he would score and the techniques he used for scoring</li>
<li>who his heroes were and how they inspired his play</li>
<li>other aspects of play like heading, passing and set pieces</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Also, while Henry has one quote per paragraph, mainly to give flavour to the text, Bellamy's section has a quote in nearly every sentence, overwhelming the text.—<a href="/wiki/User:Indopug" title="User:Indopug">indopug</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Indopug" title="User talk:Indopug">talk</a>) 16:10, 3 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>While it's unlikely I'll be able to get into Henry's level of detail due to the sheer amount of coverage he has, I've added an extra paragraph from a few sources I dug up.

<p>Not much to say. Article looks pretty good. I have some comments though.
</p>
<ul><li>"Virgil I. Grissom" Suggest "Gus Grissom"</li>
<li>"Duke was 36 years old at the time of Apollo 16" Add that this made Duke the youngest person to walk on the Moon. A record he still holds, although he's now 85. (You do mention it in "Lunar surface")</li>
<li>I might have also mentioned that Gene Cernan was Slayton's first pick for LMP, but declined in favour of commanding his own mission.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Reading from Slayton's memoirs, he says that happened in the backup crew selection for 13 so it may be better to just skip it in the 16 article.--<a href="/wiki/User:Wehwalt" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wehwalt" title="User talk:Wehwalt">talk</a>) 18:39, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Flight directors during Apollo had a one-sentence job description," Suggest colon instead of comma</li>
<li>I don't think the "Mission insignia and call signs" section is properly a part of the "Crew and key mission personnel" section. Suggest altering the indentation to put it on the same level.</li>
<li>"ALSEP and other surface equipment": Given how much detail we have here, could we mention that the ALSEP was powered by a <a href="/wiki/SNAP-27" class="mw-redirect" title="SNAP-27">SNAP-27</a> isotopic power system?</li>
<li>Do we really need all that material in fn 68?</li>
<li>"The first and second stages of the Saturn V" Given that we've already mentioned the S-IC, suggest referring to them as S-IC and S-II, linking the latter.</li>
<li>"At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about 140,000 nautical miles (260,000 km) away from Earth. At the beginning of day three, the spacecraft was about 157,000 nautical miles (291,000 km)" Why isn't the end of day two the same as the beginning of day three?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>That is, the start of day three takes into account the sleep period. I'll rephrase.--<a href="/wiki/User:Wehwalt" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wehwalt" title="User talk:Wehwalt">talk</a>) 18:39, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"This had been attempted on Apollo 15, but the camera malfunctioned." Ambiguity here; it worked okay on Apollo 16.</li>
<li>"53.1 x 67.8 nmi" Metric conversion required.</li>
<li>"The spacecraft and its crew was retrieved by USS <i>Ticonderoga</i>." State that it is an aircraft carrier on first mention.</li>
<li>"The aircraft carrier USS <i>Ticonderoga</i> delivered" Just <i>Ticoderoga</i> now.</li>
<li>"He left two items on the Moon, both of which he photographed." Ambiguity here; he didn't take the photograph; NASA photographer Ludy Benjamin did. Duke photographed the photograph on the Moon.</li>
<li>"(NASA Photo AS16-117-18841)" Do we need this?</li>
<li>I don't think "Pacific Ocean" needs to be linked.</li>
<li>"They were safely aboard the Ticonderoga 37 minutes after splashdown." Ambiguity here: by "they" do mean just the crew, or both crew and the spacecraft?</li>
<li>link "lieutenant commander", "Lunar Roving Vehicle", aircraft carrier</li>
<li>Duplicate links: Apollo 13, Saturn V, Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (I wonder why they didn't abbreviate it as FUC?), regolith, South Ray (x 2), North Ray (x 2), United States Air Force, splashed down, reaction control system</li>
<li>Matter of personal taste, but I'd dump the poor image of the LM liftoff and substitute one of the nice ones of the recovery.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think a lunar picture works better here, although as you point out, the still isn't the greatest.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Strongly recommend that metric consistently be used first
<dl><dd>I think the Apollo suite of articles need to be consistent about this, and right now we're using miles first.

<ul><li>First and foremost, it would be more appropriate to use a comma after "2013" from the note "LaBelle's debut studio album was initially set for a 2012 release, later being delayed to 2013. and was ultimately never released".

<p>I only have a few minor comments:
</p>
<ul><li>I believe the author of the AllMusic review for <i>American Idol Season 3: Greatest Soul Classics</i> is <i>Heather</i> Phares. Since her name is already mentioned in the author parameter, perhaps you could replace the current title with the name of the compilation album.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yikes, Heater was a very silly mistake on my part.

<ul><li>The citation for <a href="/wiki/Tophit" title="Tophit">Tophit</a> suggests that the reader can only found her chart history by manually searching for her name on the site (maybe you cited this site before its current display). I would suggest either directing to her <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://tophit.ru/en/artist/Leah_LaBelle">artist page</a> or simply changing the format of the current source to match with the <i>Billboard</i> ones (since "Lolita" is her only entry).

<ul><li>"the five-track sampler album". If it's only five tracks, can it be called an album? As you may agree, albums have almost always at least 8 tracks; in my lifetime I feel like I've seen a few with fewer, but only when some of the songs are especially long, like <a href="/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)" title="Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)">Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)</a>.

<dl><dd><ul><li>That is a good point and I agree with you. I went with "sampler" by itself as this terminology has been used by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8097504/rasual-butler-leah-labelle-dead"><i>Billboard</i></a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://deadline.com/2018/01/leah-labelle-dead-rasual-butler-american-idol-car-crash-1202275829/"><i>Deadline Hollywood</i></a>. I have seen "album sampler" used by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.rap-up.com/2012/05/01/leah-labelle-previews-5-tracks-off-debut-album/"><i>Rap-Up</i></a>, but I think "sampler" by itself is more concise while still being descriptive enough to be understood by readers (even more so with the link to the <a href="/wiki/Sampler_album" title="Sampler album">sampler album</a> article). I think this change in terminology actually helps to clarify other points about this, like why it was distributed to only record companies and was not a public release. Maybe it's just me, but I find samplers to be such an odd yet interesting format, but maybe that's because I am not really that familiar with it. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:17, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"LaBelle said the sampler represented her debut album's sound". First of all, is there any word that you can use instead of "represented"? It doesn't seem as clear to me as would be ideal. Maybe something like "resembled", that's just one idea. But a bigger issue is I got confused here because the info about the album not being released is in a footnote, which I initially missed. I suggest bringing it all out into the main text. Also, it's hinted later in the article that the reason the album wasn't release was due to the lack of success of her singles? If that reason (or another reason) is stated explicitly in your sources, it'd be great if that could be brought to the fore in this section. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 04:57, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised. I have revised the part you mentioned as it was not entirely accurate. Apologies for that mistake and thank you for bringing it to my attention. Heard said the single's lack of success led to LaBelle feeling trapped and giving up hope on her music career. He did not explicitly tie this to the album. I looked back over the sources, and unfortunately, none of them provide an explanation for why the album was not released (or even speculate on it as they just mentioned it did not happen). I would believe the singles' lack of success would be a factor, but that is just speculation on my part and there could have been other issues, like things within the labels. I hope that clears it up, but let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you for bringing this up as it helped to improve the article a lot. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 17:12, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"LaBelle was also a dancer in the 24-hour music video for Williams' 2013 single "Happy"."

<ul><li>Struck me as possibly too much detail in "Death and aftermath", especially in the second paragraph, maybe also in the first.

I have removed the bit about the obituary though as the exact date it was published and the newspaper do not need to be directly stated in the prose as it is already being used as a citation in this article.

<p>I think the lead should include specifically that she died in a drunk driving crash, not just that she died in a crash. It would only take a few extra words, and it's an important (albeit unflattering) piece of context for an important part of her biography that's given due weight in the body.

I am uncertain about calling it a "drunk driving crash" though. Yes, Butler's autopsy did show that he had an elevated blood alcohol level, but I am hesitant to use "drunk driving crash" as I have not seen this reported in sources and I would rather not put in that kind of information if it was not explicitly stated in a source. I have seen sources call it a single-car accident so that might be a helpful to clarify. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 22:51, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>Mostly going to look over the sources and footnotes since other commenters above have covered the prose and the images.
</p>
<ul><li>Note A - Not sure that it's necessary to have the detail about her name in a footnote at the beginning. I looked at other high-quality articles for performers with shortened stage names (<a href="/wiki/Madonna" title="Madonna">Madonna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beyonce" class="mw-redirect" title="Beyonce">Beyonce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Grande" title="Ariana Grande">Ariana Grande</a> for example) and none of them had anything like that. Not a hill I'll die on if you feel it should stay where it is, but that detail could possibly be moved to the main text, maybe in paragraph 3 where she auditions for AI.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Removed. To be honest though, this is case is different than the three you have mentioned. Madonna and Beyonce are mostly known by their first names and Ariana Grande is an example of a performer changing their last name via marriage but retaining their more well-known stage name. In LaBelle's case, she used her middle name as her last name, which is different than those three instances, and I thought it was worth pointing out in case there was any confusion. I have still removed the citation, but I just wanted to provide my explanation for its inclusion in the first place. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 22:55, 7 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>A battle of some 2,261 years ago from an obscure war for which detailed sources have survived and been reasonably analysed by modern scholars.

<ul><li>The dab page <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bagradas_River" class="mw-disambig" title="Battle of the Bagradas River">Battle of the Bagradas River</a> (and some redirects to this article) suggest that it is also known as the "Battle of the Macar".  Is this a valid enough alternate name to warrant mention?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Not IMO. <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert" title="Gustave Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> had a fictional Battle of Macar in his novel (in French) <i>Salammbô</i> published in 1862 loosely based on this battle. Apart from Wiki-mirror sites and discussion of the novel "Battle of Macar" never comes up in the literature.
<dl><dd>I did some searching as well after I posted the review, and I agree with you here.  I can only really find this attested in Flaubert and a few stray references in the now rather dated works of Gibbon.  Macar doesn't seem to be a widely accepted alternate name by any means</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Eventually an additional 70,000 men, according to the ancient Roman historian Polybius, although many would have been tied down in garrisoning their home towns against Carthaginian retribution." - this doesn't feel like a complete sentence</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yeah - I have added a verb. Always a handy thing to have in a sentence.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"They continued to restrict landward access to Carthage from their stronghold at Tunis and by establishing a force of 10,000 men in a fortified camp at the only bridge over the lower Bagradas River (the modern Medjerda River)" - Sometime feels off to me here, phrasing-wise.  My guess is that either the "and" is superfluous or something is missing at the end of the sentence</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Reads fine to me, but rewritten slightly to, hopefully, flow better. See what you think.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Rebel losses were 6,000 killed and 2,000 captured" - Is this an estimate by Bagnall (in which case recommend attributing it to him), or is this the number found in the ancient sources?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Why attribute? Everything in the article is found in a HQ RS secondary source. Should I attribute each sentence? Miles gives "Over 8,000 of the enemy were either killed or captured", Hoyos "6,000 rebels died ... 2,000 prisoners", so it seems to be the consensus of modern scholars. (None attribute it in text.)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Just double checking to make sure that the chapter for Eckstein really does have the exact same title as the overall book</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Of course not. Thank you. Fixed.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>There's a typo in File:Macar240.PNG (it's instead of its), but I doubt its fixable so no action needed here</li>
<li>It's not clear what Hanno was doing during the time span of Hamilcar's force until you get to the statement "While Hanno manoeuvred against Mathos to the north near Hippo,".  Can something be added further up in the article to make it clearer where Hanno was while Hamilcar was fighting at the river?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Just checking, over and above "For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian Nigel Bagnall writes of Hanno's "incompetence as a field commander"."?</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Ah. What one is supposed to have is the base unit unabbreviated at first mention and all others abbreviated. If you look above you will find CPA-5 ticking me off over this.
<dl><dd>I just realized that the conv template abbreviates the units being converted to. That's what had me confused. It just seems weird to have metres/ft rather than metres/feet in the first mention. Presumably the purpose of the full form is to identify the unit for the reader.

<p>Overall a well written article. There's a marked dearth of commas, but I have a habit of excessive comma use so I don't know if that's just me anticipating more of them than is needed or if there's commas missing in places. *shrug*. I also left a note above in CPAs section.

In this case, a regional identity is much more informative than either of the two possible national ones. Regarding the use of 'disabuse': I don't think there is anything wrong with the word per se; I rather think that it's problematic for Wikipedia's voce to use it in this instance because it could create the impression that the article disapproves of Paine's atheist views. In other words, you'd typically use the verb in a situation where you believe that that of  which someone must be disabused is in some way untruthful/harmful etc., which Kohlmann and Fenwick probably did. It's not a big deal anyway.

<p>This article is about William McAndrew, an educator who, among other roles, served as superintendent of Chicago Public Schools.
</p><p>While his career as an educator is noteworthy, and interesting enough, the really fascinating part is how his tenure as Chicago's superintendent ended. During William Hale Thompson's 1927 mayoral campaign, he accused McAndrew of feeding schoolchildren British propaganda as part of a supposed plot for the UK to retake the United States. Months after Thompson won the mayoral election, the school board, now under Thompson's control, suspended McAndrew, and conducted a trial against him. It's a truly fascinating story.
</p><p>The article is well-researched, using contemporary news articles, modern (retrospective) news articles, multiple books, and doctoral paper as some of its sources. It is comprehensive, providing great focus on all noteworthy aspects of his life I was able to find. It is very neutral. It is definitely stable. It complies with our copyright policy
</p><p>The article has appropriate structure. The lead is properly constructed. I believe there are not any problems with the citation style.
</p><p>There is appropriate public-domain media to illustrate the article.
</p><p>The length of the article, while detailing a multitude of subject matter relating to McAndrew, is not overbearingly long.

<li>There are issues with the section length making the article difficult to read. Readers on mobile in particular are going to get lost in a lot of text without subheadings to break it up. I would break up "Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools" (before the subheadings) as well as the trial section. On the other hand, there is no reason for minuscule separate top level subsections for personal life and death. You can fix that by combining later career and death and consider merging the personal life into the chronological progression as it's hard to justify a separate section for just a couple sentences.

<li>The lead says that the season received "mixed ratings", but this is not clearly said in the Critical response subsection. I would also say "reviews" instead of "ratings" as I think that word choice sound odd in this context.
<ul><li>Changed reviews to ratings. I personally thought that the mixed reviews were interpreted from the reviews themselves, some reviewers saying that the beach was confusing, Dempsey's return was a bad idea, and stories being ripped from memes; while others spoke about the new normal, nostalgia, and comfort in characters. <a href="/wiki/User:TheDoctorWho" title="User:TheDoctorWho"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>The</b></span><span style="color:#0000ff"><b>Doctor</b></span><span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>Who</b></span></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheDoctorWho" title="User talk:TheDoctorWho">(talk)</a> 04:41, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<li>I have a question about this sentence: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Despite initial uncertainty from the cast, crew, and the network, the series was eventually renewed for an <a href="/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_(season_18)" title="Grey&#39;s Anatomy (season 18)">eighteenth season</a>.</q> Please correct me if I am wrong, but I thought this uncertainty mostly came from whether or not Pompeo wanted to leave the show or not and it has been said in the past, once Pompeo leaves, the show would end. Is this accurate or was this uncertainty caused by more widespread things?
<ul><li>I think Pompeo's contract expiring was one of the largest reasons for the concern but there were some sources (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://ew.com/tv/greys-anatomy-boss-season-17-more-shocks-to-come/">[4]</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-boss-approaching-season-17-ender-as-potential-series-finale-4146381/">[5]</a>) where Vernoff blamed it on ABC executives but their specific reason remained unlisted. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://deadline.com/2020/06/greys-anatomy-season-18-abc-boss-hopeful-talks-medical-drama-future-get-underway-1202960909/">This one used in the article</a>] does mention Pompeo's contract but also says that the pandemic made things uncertain and said that part of it depended on whether or not the production team was interested in creating more episodes post-17. <a href="/wiki/User:TheDoctorWho" title="User:TheDoctorWho"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>The</b></span><span style="color:#0000ff"><b>Doctor</b></span><span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>Who</b></span></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheDoctorWho" title="User talk:TheDoctorWho">(talk)</a> 04:41, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<li>Shouldn't the lead have a brief sentence that provides an overview of the series (or at least an overview for the series for that season)?

<p>I used to be a huge <i>Grey Anatomy</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span>s fan, but I honestly stopped watching a while back as I was disappointed in the show's direction.

I would clarify this further.</li>
<li>I've been told in the past to not link Los Angeles as it is a very recognizable city so it is often seen as an example of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Overlinking" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Overlinking">overlinking</a>.</li>

<li>I would link <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>. I know this sounds silly, but there may be a day that some readers may be unfamiliar with DVDs since the way television is consumed is now different with streaming.</li>
<li>For the Critical response subsection, I would see if there is a way to make the content flow more seamlessly from one point to the next. Right now, it jumps arounds a little too much. For instance, the first sentence is about <i><a href="/wiki/NBC_Think" class="mw-redirect" title="NBC Think">NBC Think</a></i> praising the show for its accuracy and portrayal of COVID-19 and then the next sentence is about <i><a href="/wiki/TVLine" title="TVLine">TVLine</a></i>'s critiques of the beach scenes. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Reception" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Reception">WP:RECEPTION</a> is a great resource. Apologies if you have already been linked to this in the past. The content in this subsection is very good. My concern is with the organization and structure.</li>
<li>For the <i>Showbuzz Daily</i> citations, I would avoid having parts of the titles in all caps, even if the publication does this in their own titles. I would look through the other citations to avoid this (like for Exclusive in Citation 41 and Recap in Citation 49).</li></ul>

<p>I'll have a look after the bank holiday here <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 09:54, 30 August 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>OK, a few nitpicks <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 13:04, 31 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I’m surprised that we don’t get to see what it may have looked like until the final image. Even if you would rather have the bones in the infobox, I’d still move the image up. If it falls to me to list this at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TFA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TFA">WP:TFA</a>, I definitely think the reconstruction would be a better hook in the blurb than the bones.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>This might be as confusing as the issues below, but when I first found the free version of the image in a 1997 journal article, it was listed as showing the related Réunion sheldgoose. So I originally added it to the article to just show a similar relative. But I since recognised the same image in the 2008 book Lost Land of the Dodo (also used as a source here), where it is captioned as showing the Mauritius sheldgoose... So I noted the two different identities in the Commons description, and just changed the caption here to reflect the newer, 2008 source, which is co-written by the artist. I can only speculate why the image has been used to show both, but in reality, we have no idea what the difference between the two species were, or if there were any. The IOC list even says of the Réunion species "Treated as conspecific with A. mauritiana by R. Roe (pers. comm.)", but we can't really cite unpublished comments...</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>So that is one reason why I didn't place it more prominently, another reason is that all we know are the bones, so anything but them are pure speculation, and the next most reliable imagery would then be the contemporary drawing, which is now under description. And since the restoration also shows the environment and another species from the area, I thought it would be appropriate in the section about ecology. As for showing what the species looked like earlier, the Egyptian goose image early on aready does that, since as you can see, the painting looks almost identical to it. But I agree, if this goes to the front page, the restoration will be more eye-catching. <a href="/wiki/User:FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 14:27, 31 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>OK, as long as it's a deliberate placement, that's fine <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 14:58, 31 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><i>and placed in the shelduck genus Alopochen.</i> &#8212; possibly misleading. <i>The</i> shelduck genus is <i><a href="/wiki/Tadorna" title="Tadorna">Tadorna</a></i>, and although it's in the same subfamily, Egyptian goose isn't normally described as a shelduck</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Might be solved if the article is moved to sheldgoose, per below. But note that I brought the issue of shelducks/sheldgeese up here<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Birds#What_makes_a_shelduck/sheldgoose?">[11]</a>, and it seems to be a bit of a messy situation. <a href="/wiki/User:FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 13:43, 31 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yeah, this is is because many of our articles about these obscure species are not currently aligned with the IOC, and have to be moved. In the case of this article, checking the IOC list now<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRX8OQ82D2Y8dGrpDQHGQPkrBdJrjTTTI-StF7BueLQ607bI0XC0upkOhTMCDI8BwzP5VA0SENl8wLn/pubhtml?gid=106050083&amp;single=true">[12]</a>, it may even have to be moved to Mauritius sheldgoose. I think I moved it to the current location because that was the IUCN name, which I thought would match the IOC name, but seems they're not aligned.

<dl><dd>One solution could perhaps be that I change all occurrences of "shelduck" to "sheldgoose in the article now, and then get the article title changed after the FAC?

<ul><li><i>It was probably driven to extinction due to overhunting and predation by introduced animals.</i> – a bit frustratingly unspecific.

<dl><dd>The MET permission page that specifically mentions images and each one has a PD tag and link to the permission statement below the image, so there should be no issue there.

<p>Hi Ceoil, I hope you've been well. Here, no big complaints.&#160;:-) This article seems pretty interesting and I am having a look. You'll notice I'm also making some mini-edits along the way. Here are the comments I have so far, probably more to come:
</p>
<ul><li>Wiki-link "frontispiece"?</li>
<li>"The figures are dressed in long tinics and cloaks, and depicted in a style that closely resemble those found on the cumdachs of the near contemporary Stowe Missal and slightly later Breac Maodhóg.[20]" I suggest something like "those of" before "Breac Maodhóg". I think you definitely need something here for flow. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 18:28, 29 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>"The shrine is in poor condition, especially the top "roof" or "house-shaped" portions are lost, as are some of its jewels." Here "especially" doesn't quite seem to work, I'd argue. I <i>think</i> it's trying to say that the main reason we can say the shrine is in poor condition is that some parts of it are missing. Nothing immediately jumps out at me as a good succinct way to say that, but there surely is one. (It's late here and my brain's not at 100%.) Well, see if you have any ideas for a good way to reword it, otherwise I'll try again to come up with something in my next read-through. Cheers, <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 07:09, 2 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>OK, great, I'm beginning my second read-through... <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 01:08, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>"The figures and other elements dated to this last phase can be identified as they are soldered to the plates." I admit I'm a little confused by this sentence. Maybe this just means that we know which components (figures and other elements) were added later (not in the 8th century) because there is evidence of soldering—and soldering suggests they were added after the fact, not in the original phase? But maybe what threw me was the next sentence talks about how we know the dating of the inner core (8th century), so I was kind of expecting it would be logical that this previous sentence was about how we likewise know this part dates from the 15th century. But then when I re-read it I saw the sentence was about something slightly different... I think. Is there information in the sources about how we can date it to the 15th century, and if so would it be worthwhile to add it? I'm not sure whether other people would get confused by the flow of this sentence, or if it was just me. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 01:26, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li>
<li>Now I've got to the next sentence "The major elements date to the 11th century." So that's the 1001–1011 from the previous paragraph. But I see 1001–1011 is repeated again in this paragraph. Could I suggest it might be clearer to reorganize the two paragraphs to be totally chronological: (1) Everything we know about the 8th century phase; (2) Everything we know about the 11th century phase; (3) Everything we know about the 15th century phase. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 01:35, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the manuscript that is mentioned in Dating is the same thing as the gospel book that is mentioned elsewhere? Oh yes, I see this is stated in the lead: "original object held a now-lost companion text, presumed to be a small illuminated gospel book". But since the lead is supposed to outside of the narrative of the main text, the mention of "its manuscript" in the main text seems kind of sudden, as though it's assumed there has already been mention of it—but the only mention so far has been in the lead.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Related to this, I notice the sentence "That book was, until the 19th century, believed to have been transcribed by Molaisse" in the lead is cited to Overbey, but under Description "until the early 19th century the Gospel of St. Molaisse was thought to have been written by the saint himself; one late medieval text describes how it was, as surmised by the art historian Raghnall Ó Floinn, "sent down to him from heaven while on a pilgrimage to Rome" " is cited to Ó Floinn. Maybe both Overbey and Ó Floinn said that until the early 19th century the Gospel of St. Molaisse was thought to have been written by the saint himself, I'm not sure. But it's unusual to have a citation in the lead, and I'd argue it would be more usual to put the citation just here in the main text. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 01:56, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>"It was enshrined in the 11th century with a cumdach made up of plain sheets of tinned bronze decorated with openwork plates of gilded silver and mountings". This seems like a possible repeat of "the rather plain[3] 8th-century wooden core has bronze casing, that was heavily embellished and added to between 1001–1011 when silver plaques were fastened with nails and rivets". If so, it's a bit confusing to the reader to be presented the same info again, and they're not sure if it's meant to be different from what they already read. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 02:03, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I'm just asking because the wording is so similar, but are the "panels on the front face are missing, and those that remain are in bronze and silver-gilt" the same as "plain sheets of tinned bronze decorated with openwork plates of gilded silver"? And regardless of whether they are, if the description should be kept in both places, should the wiki-link on "silver-gilt" be instead around "gilded silver"? <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 02:09, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li>
<li>Condition and restorations: "The 15th-century additions seem to have consisted of embossed silver plates, but are now also mostly lost". This is stated as though it's the first time it's being mentioned, but this was already said in Dating. Maybe the sentence can be tweaked to subtly acknowledge that this has already been mentioned. One idea, something like: "The shrine is in poor condition; in addition to the lost silver plates from the 15th century additions, the top "roof" or "house-shaped" portions are also lost, as are some of its jewels."</li>
<li>Molaisse is introduced in the lead as "associated with Saint Laisrén mac Nad Froích (d. 564 or 571), also known as Molaisse or "Mo Laisse". In the 6th century, Molaisse founded a church on Devenish Island in the southern part of Lough Erne in County Fermanagh, which the cumdach is associated with." Then in the main text he is mentioned in passing "a successor of Molaisse..." as though Molaisse has already been introduced, but he hasn't yet in the main text, only in the lead. These details about "Saint Laisrén mac Nad Froích (d. 564 or 571)" and "founded a church on Devenish Island in the southern part of Lough Erne in County Fermanagh" don't seem to be in the main text at all, unless I missed them.</li></ul>

<p>This article is about the murders of two tourists in Thailand. The coverage in sources largely focused on the police investigation and trial, which received a lot of international attention. It went through GA in March and peer review in April. It's my first FA nomination; hoping to get the article up to scratch and understand the FA criteria better. Appreciate any &amp; all reviews! <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 15:53, 25 August 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I am a little concerned about the sourcing. For an article about a murder and resulting trial, one would expect the judgment itself to be cited at least a few times. On the flipside, a rather large amount of news media are cited - I dunno if these are really high-quality sources, oversimplifications, simple mistakes and overly-hasty/sensationalistic coverage is very common. I am not outright opposing because I am not sure if my concerns about news media not being high quality sources are shared by anyone, though. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 16:44, 25 August 2021 (UTC)

The verdict was cited to CNN and BBC, and also discussed in the peer-reviewed journal article (I've just added a ref to that, too).

<dl><dd>See, my impression is that courts usually write out their reasoning when issuing a judgment, rather than making a mere "The defendant(s) is/are guilty/innocent". I'd expect that reasoning to be used as a source - at least for some things - in a FA about a trial. I'd be wary of using second-hand news media reports as a substitute for the actual judgment, they tend to oversimplify and often there is an error or two in the coverage. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 17:05, 25 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ah, I see what you mean now. I haven't seen any sources refer to a written judgement, and it wasn't referred to in the journal article either. The Court didn't allow observers to take notes, but there are some written from memory. I found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/55373357/sihrg-koh-tao-murders-trial-report">this</a> report from an observer; in the second half of the document there is an unofficial English translation of the court's judgement (~40 pages long). I don't know where the original Thai version would be (maybe <a href="/wiki/User:Paul_012" title="User:Paul 012">Paul_012</a> will know?) I've read the first few pages of the translation and it mostly matches up with what the article says, but with some additional details (eg details of the rape, where the pair stayed after immigrating illegally, etc); some of it could be added for detail, other parts fall a bit foul of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SUMMARYSTYLE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SUMMARYSTYLE">WP:SUMMARYSTYLE</a>.

<p>I was contacted about this article back in January or February. I was emailed again a few days ago. This article needs to be removed from FAC; it may even need to be put up for deletion. It's horribly wrong. 
</p><p><b>1. The "Reaction" section</b>.   
</p><p>This section tells us that "the investigation was met with criticism by international media, human rights groups, and legal experts". It explains that "practically no one believes [the Burmese pair] brutally murdered the English tourists".
</p><p>And yet on December 24 2015 -- the day when the verdict was delivered -- someone stood outside the Samui courthouse and said this:   
</p><p><b>Concern for the accused has been widespread. A petition was organized and funds were raised for their benefit. A group of activists became involved and has promoted their cause vigorously to the media. Ultimately, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo have obtained the possible representation in court, by a team of seven top lawyers.</b> 
</p><p><b>Over the last few months we have attended many of the court sittings, and we have gained real respect for this court. The judges have been invariably diligent, attentive, fair, and extraordinarily hardworking. This has been a comfort to us.</b> 
</p><p><b>David always stood up for justice, and justice is what has been delivered today. We respect this court and its decision completely.</b>
</p><p><b>As the trial has progressed, we came to realize the police investigation and the forensic work performed was not the so-called shambles it was made out to be. We believe that after a difficult start, the Royal Thai Police conducted a methodical and thorough investigation.</b>
</p><p><b>Having listened carefully to all the evidence, and despite what their lawyers say, it is our opinion that the evidence against Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin is absolutely overwhelming. They raped to satisfy their selfish desires and murdered to cover up that fact. They have shown no remorse during the trial.</b>
</p><p><b>Initially they confessed for almost two weeks, and then recanted in an attempt to avoid justice.</b>
</p><p>The man who read this statement -- outside the Samui courthouse on December 24, 2015 (immediately after the verdict was delivered) -- was David Miller's bother.
</p><p>So how come it's not in the article? How come it's not shown prominently [in a quote box] right at the very top of the Reaction section? 
</p><p>See the second video -- <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688</a> -- and you'll understand why your article needs to be completely re-written.
</p><p><b>2. Why?</b>
</p><p>Why did the Miller family disagree so vehemently with the narrative published in left-wing articles. Put another way, why was the world's left-wing media so overtly in favor of the "Burmese Pair", and the Miller family wasn't. Here's why. 
</p><p><b>2.1. Left Wing Media</b>
</p><p>The left wing has one core value: harm reduction. This value is especially important when it pertains to marginalized minorities. Do I really need to say any more? Poor, sweet sweet sweet, darling little Burmese. How could these sweet darling little people every commit a crime?
</p><p><b>2.2. The British Police</b>
</p><p>Britain's PM, David Cameron, had a chat with the PM of Thailand. They decided that Britain's Metropolitan Police would send a team to Thailand to check things out. Your article alludes to this. It says the results were never made public. Sure. Cool. Great. What it doesn't say it this:
</p><p><b>The two leaders agreed that Britain's Metropolitan Police would send a team to Thailand to conduct an independent inquiry. However, as it is British policy not to assist foreign police forces in death penalty cases, the scope of the mission was to observe and record the Thai police investigation.</b>
</p><p><b>Thai police cooperated fully under the pre-agreed condition that the British team's final report would be shared only with the Witheridge and Miller families.</b>  
</p><p>Source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-murder-suspects-cant-have-british-police-report-uk-judge">https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-murder-suspects-cant-have-british-police-report-uk-judge</a>
</p><p>So now we know the Miller family were privy to knowledge that no one other than the UK government and the Witheridge family had access to. And remember: the Miller family's comments were diametrically opposed to all the shit spouted by scummy left-wing sources.
</p><p><b>3. Pornthip Rojanasunand: a Thai forensic scientist</b>
</p><p>Your article tells me that Ms Pornthip testified ..... yada yada yada. Ever heard of the GT200? They were empty plastic boxes with a pair of antennae attached. SCAM. They were sold as bomb detectors. SCAM. The Brit dude who made them is now in prison. Thailand fell for the scam and bought them. Ms Pornthip vouched for them. Google this and you'll see why Ms Pornthip has less credibility than a dog turd.
</p><p><b>4. Archiving</b>
</p><p>All web sources need to be archived. Like it or not, link rot will kick in sooner rather than later and your [largely worthless] article will suffer. 
</p><p><b>5. Primary sources</b>
</p><p>You have nearly 85 sources. About 20% of these links point to an "unofficial translation" of a primary source. Do you really not get this? Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Primary sources are permissible, but in general Wikipedia wants secondary sources that "interpret" primary sources. Your sourcing is just plain wrong. Ask a mod to explain this to you.
</p><p><b>6. Conclusion</b>
</p><p>Withdraw the article. It's not FA standard. It's a bummer. Re-write it. Try again. Better luck next time. <span class="autosigned" style="font-size:85%;">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JusticeForDavidMiller&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JusticeForDavidMiller (page does not exist)">JusticeForDavidMiller</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JusticeForDavidMiller&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:JusticeForDavidMiller (page does not exist)">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/JusticeForDavidMiller" title="Special:Contributions/JusticeForDavidMiller">contribs</a>) </span>

<dl><dd>Thanks for your comments. Some responses:</dd>
<dd>In regards to #1: On the latter quote: no, it only says an opinion piece in the Bangkok Post said that, with intext attribution. It provides helpful context for the background underlying the media reporting. I can add in that the family supported the verdict if I can find a source for it; the one you linked says the brother supported it and the family needed time to digest it.</dd>
<dd>In regards to #2.2: Thanks; I've clarified that British police only went to observe the investigation. I don't see anything else actionable in #2.2 though; implying that Miller's family knew more than everyone else, when the sources don't seem to say that, would be OR. I've added in that the families of the victims got access to the reports, and readers can make their own deductions if they wish.</dd>
<dd>Re #3: Do you have a source contrasting Pornthip's comments against her previous error? Either way, I don't mind removing the single sentence in question, which is: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Pornthip Rojanasunand, a Thai forensic scientist, testified at the trial that the crime scene was poorly managed.</q></dd>
<dd>Re #4: I can run IABot on it, though I don't think future link rot is as much of an issue with Reuters/BBC/NYT/et al. All news sources already have archived versions in web.archive.org.</dd>
<dd>Re #5: They were added per a suggestion above. They didn't really change the article much except to clarify inconsistent details. They are not used for interpretation, but rather just to state a particular party's position (e.g. the prosecution's), for which their usage is reasonable. If anything, it moves the article closer to what seems to be your position, although that position largely doesn't exist in secondary sources. You mention that Wikipedia wants secondary sources, but the vast majority of your comments here are in support of doing OR. <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 10:37, 5 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I'm now speechless. Really speechless. I wonder if I'm even living on the same planet as you guys. 
</p><p>Here is ProcrastinatingReader's comment:
</p><p><b>On the latter quote: no, it only says an opinion piece in the Bangkok Post said that, with intext attribution. It provides helpful context for the background underlying the media reporting.

</p><p>Please notice how ProcrastinatingReader describes my quote as "an opinion piece in the Bangkok Post". Let's go through this again.
</p><p>Here is my quote:
</p><p><b>Concern for the accused has been widespread. A petition was organized and funds were raised for their benefit. A group of activists became involved and has promoted their cause vigorously to the media. Ultimately, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo have obtained the best possible representation in court, by a team of seven top lawyers.</b>

</p><p><b>Initially they confessed for almost two weeks, and then recanted in an attempt to avoid justice.</b>
</p><p>So, boys and girls, here's the punchline: the above quote has NOTHING to do with the Bangkok Post. It's from the BBC. 
</p><p>This is the source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688</a>. Watch and listen to the second video. 
</p><p>Yet ProcrastinatingReader says "it only says an opinion piece in the Bangkok Post ...."
</p><p>Where the EFF is ProcrastinatingReader getting the Bangkok Post from when I'm linking to the BBC?
</p><p>Do you think that perhaps -- just perhaps -- someone here doesn't know what he's talking about? Simple question, huh?
</p><p>Let's move forward. This is gonna get worse for ProcrastinatingReader. Much worse. Not my fault. Nothing to do with me. I'm about to show how totally clueless this guy is. 
</p><p>ProcrastinatingReader wrote: 
</p><p><b>I can add in that the family supported the verdict if I can find a source for it; the one you linked says the brother supported it and the family needed time to digest it.</b>
</p><p>Well, eh, ProcrastinatingReader has a source. The BBC. This: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35173688</a>
</p><p>Let's examine ProcrastinatingReader's comment: <b>the brother supported it and the family needed time to digest it.</b>
</p><p>1. Two Brits were murdered on Koh Tao.
</p><p>2. One was a young man with surname Miller.
</p><p>3. The other was a young woman with the surname Witheridge.
</p><p>So two families were involved: Miller and Witheridge.
</p><p>Let's look again at the BBC article:
</p><p><b>The family of Mr Miller attended the hearing but relatives of Miss Witheridge did not travel to Thailand for the verdicts.</b>
</p><p><b>Her family said the verdict had left them "in the path of a whirlwind of emotions and difficulties".</b>
</p><p><b>In a statement they said: "The past year has served as an unimaginably impossible time for our family. We have found the trial process extremely difficult and our trips out to Thailand, to attend court, made for particularly distressing experiences.</b>
</p><p><b>"We found listening to proceedings very challenging and we have had to endure a lot of painful and confusing information. We now need time, as a family, to digest the outcome of the trial and figure out the most appropriate way to tell our story."</b>
</p><p>The key comment is "digest the outcome of the trial". This comment was made by the Witheridge family -- the family of the murdered girl.
</p><p>ProcrastinatingReader writes: "the one you linked says the brother supported it and the family needed time to digest it". <b>Do you see how ProcrastinatingReader can't even differentiate between the family of the murdered boy [Miller] and the family of the raped and murdered girl [Witheridge].</b>
<b></b>
This article is a disgrace. The author (who conjured this article out of thin air back in January) seems not to have a clue about any of this.

<p>I know nothing about Thailand or the events described in the article, but I don't want the only review that this article gets to be by an account which seems to have been created solely for that purpose.

<ul><li>Under <b>Background,</b> please state the year for which the data about the population of locals and migrant workers on Kon Tao applies.

<ul><li>I clarified the details and added a bit more, but looking through my saved sources not <i>too</i> much seems to be mentioned about their background.

<dl><dd>I did deeper digging. I found a bit more in local sources, but mostly only about Miller. I can't find anything on Witheridge's reasons for travelling, other than she was travelling with a few female friends. I'm not sure what direction to go to find out more, if there is anything else. I can only think of statements by family members, but of the ones I found they didn't say anything more pertinent.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Under <b>Murder</b>, what was the name of the bar where they were last seen? What is Sairee Beach and where is it in relation to the bar? Furthermore, you ought to give the name and a brief description of the hotel in the previous section, especially because it ended up being so close to where the bodies were discovered. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 22:15, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li>

<ul><li>The three sites are the vulva, perineum, and right nipple. I wasn't sure if it was too much detail but I figured it was worth adding for review since there was a lot of focus on the DNA evidence. Happy to trim it too.</li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I see. Maybe make sure it's a way to clarify that it's referring to body parts. I don't know if this is common medical or forensic terminology, but the word "site" (at least in American English, which I'm most accustomed to) is virtually always used to refer to a physical place, and never as far as I've encountered to a body part.

<li>"They focused on foreign nationals, with a spokesperson for the police claiming 'Thais wouldn't do this.'" What kind of foreign nationals? I assume you mean the migrant workers, but you have to clarify so that the reader doesn't confuse them with tourists or any other class of people that might happen to be in the country. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 22:56, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<li>I want to see more about claims of torture. I think that you should have at least one or two separate sub-sections for the first half of the "Investigation" section.

<dl><dd>I think there was an attempt to cover the events chronologically, but perhaps it would be clearer to break it up into elements. e.g. a sub-section on the timelines presented by the prosecution and defence, then a separate sub-section on the evidence and criticism on it, and then a sub-section on the trial itself. Do you think that would work better than the current structure, or did you have something else in mind?</dd></dl></li></ul>

<dl><dd>The judgement just says that it was Mau Mau's house. Since they were illegal it could be that they were living in his house permanently, too, or could have been some kind of sleepover. I got a copy of the judgement of the Appeals Court which is more specific in details but is contradicting on this particular. The Appeals Court judgement suggests this residence was AC2's "staff housing" (AC2 being a business where Mau Mau worked). It also says Zaw Lin was arrested at a different residence. I'd feel more confident if I had a copy of the Supreme Court judgement (which supposedly reiterates the entire case in detail) but I looked, as did <a href="/wiki/User:Paul_012" title="User:Paul 012">Paul_012</a>, and we couldn't find it, but in its stead I can try clarify the details based on the Appeals Court judgement. <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 01:01, 9 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

<li>"The police then forced the suspects to re-enact the murder in front of media,[34] a move condemned by legal experts as prejudicing a fair hearing.[15]" It seems like this happened at the trial.

<li>"...Selby succumbing to the Crucible curse. Selby was the 16th first-time champion who failed to defend his title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977." Do you think it might be better to reword this a bit, perhaps rearranging the order in which the information is presented? As phrased, it's not explicitly clear what the Crucible Curse is. I'm thinking of something like "McGill won the match 13–9, making Selby the 16th first-time champion who failed to defend his title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977, succumbing to what has become known as the 'Crucible curse'."

<p>This is presumably around the time that Sterling Price realized his 1864 Missouri Raid was in big trouble, as the Union managed to get sizable bodies of troops to the east and west of the Confederates, with a river to the north.  Second Independence represents the Confederates' attempt to hold a rear guard long enough for the main body of the army fought a way across Byram's Ford.

<ul><li>For the lead, I think "1864 United States Presidential Election" should be "United States presidential election."

<li>"By September 1864, the Confederacy had essentially no chance of a military victory..." A little too strong for my taste.

<ul><li>I haven't found anything.

I did some digging in the <i>Official Records</i> and found reports on the campaign by Brown, Sanborn, and McNeil, but none break down casualties for this battle.  My guess is that there wasn't a good chance for reporting - Winslow fought well into the night, McNeil and Sanborn were both on the move early the next morning, and Brown was arrested on October 23. <a href="/wiki/User:Hog_Farm" title="User:Hog Farm">Hog Farm</a> <sub> <i><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hog_Farm" title="User talk:Hog Farm">Talk</a></i></sub> 02:18, 3 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<p>What a delightfully unexpected article! Not much by way of comment from me, but these are my few quibbles:
</p>
<ul><li><s><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">She was born into an evangelical Christian family in Kent, but after her father's death she became a campaigner against the use of plumage…</span> – the "but" seems to imply some connection or contrast between the first and second parts of the sentence, but I don't think there really is one.</s></li><s>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Frank Lemon, who became its legal advisor</span> – for such a venerable British institution it would be nice to use the traditional English "adviser" rather than the American "advisor".</li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">did not prevent them being sold</span> – I think this would be better as either "did not prevent their being sold" (gerund, and all that) or "did not prevent them from being sold".</li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">captain of muskettry</span> – spelling? You have "musketry" later, which looks more convincing to me.</li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Together with the twice-widowed Eliza Phillips</span> – I'm a little doubtful that Mrs P's twice-widowed status is all that relevant, but I do not press the point.</li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">at Phillips' home</span> – unexpected form of the possessive: wouldn't Philips's be the usual form?</li>
</s><li><s><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">outstripped by the SPB due to the latter organisation's extensive network</span> – in my book "due to" is not accepted as a compound preposition on a par with "owing to" in formal BrE.

I do not propose to wait for that to be addressed before adding my <b>support</b>, which I now do. The article is well balanced, judiciously proportioned, sensibly illustrated and, I don't doubt, as widely sourced as possible. Tessa Boase's book crops up a lot, but I can't imagine there are many alternatives, if any, and the twelve references to the ODNB – two different articles therein – give comfort that we are OK so far as FAC criterion 1c goes.

<p>I had a quick look and made a few edits already (I believe them to be minor, but please revert if I was mistaken). Before I comment in full a question: is Margaretta Louisa Lemon really the right title for this article? From your use of Etta Lemon within the article, and even in your little nomination blurb, I get the impression that Etta Lemon is the more common way to refer to her. Just a question, I have not looked into it in depth. <a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Edwininlondon" title="User talk:Edwininlondon">talk</a>) 20:34, 23 August 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li><a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a>, it's always a bit tricky with formal/informal names. There is a redirect from <a href="/wiki/Etta_Lemon" title="Etta Lemon">Etta Lemon</a>, and my earlier <a href="/wiki/Emma_Louisa_Turner" title="Emma Louisa Turner">Emma Louisa Turner</a> had the formal title despite her most frequently being referred to informally as "E L Turner", so at least it's consistent. I don't think it's like a stage name where the birth name would clearly be inappropriate. <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 12:56, 25 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li><a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a>, and on the original of the new image, she is "Mrs Frank Lemon"... <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 12:56, 25 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It's tricky indeed. Reading <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> it seems to me that "Etta Lemon" scores high on the naturalness criterion, higher than her birthname, am I right? Or is it just Tessa Boase who uses Etta Lemon? What about the other criteria? <a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Edwininlondon" title="User talk:Edwininlondon">talk</a>) 16:39, 25 August 2021 (UTC).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a> The commonest usage is Mrs Lemon in all sources. Where a first name is given, ONDB uses Etta Smith while she is unmarried, but Margaretta Lemon exclusively after her marriage. ZLS ref uses Margaretta, others just have initials Mrs M. Lemon or Mrs F. E. Lemon. Boase only occasionally uses Margaretta, overwhelmingly Etta, but then she also refers to the Duchess of Portland as "Winnie" more than once, and I doubt that we are going down that route. If you look at the RSPB site or publications, it's always Etta, but the articles are always written by Boase as her biographer. Boase definitely does informal, and is pretty well ubiquitous on the web, but that isn't reflected in the other sources. <a href="/wiki/User:Jimfbleak" title="User:Jimfbleak"><b style="font-family:Lucida;color:red">Jimfbleak</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimfbleak" title="User talk:Jimfbleak"><span style="font-family:arial;color:green"><i>talk to me?</i></span></a> 09:02, 26 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>OK, so that seems not to favour Etta as article title. But would Margaretta Lemon not be a better article title than Margaretta Louisa Lemon? And would it not be better to use Margaretta in the article text instead of Etta?</li></ul>

<p>Here goes a second attempt. The previous nomination failed to pick up much commentary, likely due to an ongoing RfC which has since been formally closed.

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Buffs" title="User:Buffs">Buffs</a>, could you expand on why you marked both as public domain? Per <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://inauguration.olemiss.edu/about-um/symbols-heraldry/">this page</a>, the seal (top) is as old as the university, so easily PD, but the crest (bottom, accompanying the wordmark) was designed in 1965, and per <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://csm.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/104/2021/01/mississippi_01-04-21-copy-1.jpg">this sheet</a> (linked from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://marcomm.olemiss.edu/creative-toolbox/">here</a>), the university appears to still be asserting trademark rights over it. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 00:59, 27 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb">Sdkb</a> BIG can of worms here, but the short version is that trademark is NOT copyright and vice versa even though both are related. Briefly: ignore trademarks for purposes of blanket inclusion on WP, but make sure they are labeled. Assess copyright whether or not trademark laws apply.</dd>
<dd>Detailed version: Copyrights only last for a certain length of time in the US. Prior to 1989, there were varying criteria such as you HAD to include the © plus you had to register it. Over time, the rules changed to what we have today: you made it? It's copyrighted for the rest of your life + 70 years. If it was first published prior to 1926, it is no longer copyrighted based on the laws at the time. There are a whole BUNCH of criteria and legal backing, but suffice to say, it can get a little tedious/complicated (for example, you can sue to have someone stop using your copyrighted works, but if you didn't register them, you cannot sue for damages or legal fees).</dd>
<dd>"But what about <i>trademarks</i>? You didn't even mention those" Hold on, hold on, I'm getting to it. Trademarks are another form of intellectual property, but do not enjoy the same exclusive protections of copyright. Trademarks are protected in the sense that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17274864/texas-aggies-lends-12th-man-trademark-seattle-seahawks-5-year-deal">others can't use it for the same purpose without compensation</a>. However, they can still be considered public domain if they do not meet the <a href="/wiki/Threshold_of_originality" title="Threshold of originality">threshold of originality</a> or copyright doesn't apply. You can use such trademarked images as long as you are using them to identify the entity to which they are associated. You cannot use them to indicate support of a concept/idea unless the entity actually does. There are even bigger fines if you use them in such a fraudulent manner (fraud is a felony!). As long as trademarks remain registered, they can be protected forever. There is no time limit on those, unlike copyright. Also, for your reference, ® means it's a registered trademark. ™ means they've applied for a trademark.</dd>
<dd>In the specific case of these two images, the first has been out of any possible copyright (if it ever was) for ~95 years. The second was shown in numerous publications without any asserted copyright prior to 1989, which is common. It was never intended to be a copyrighted image. They wanted it emblazoned everywhere! Putting a copyright on it would detract from that intent. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Trademark" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Trademark">WP:Trademark</a> for more information.</dd>
<dd>Hopefully that explains it a little more in context. <a href="/wiki/User:Buffs" title="User:Buffs">Buffs</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Buffs" title="User talk:Buffs">talk</a>) 17:13, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a>, I'm glad we're able to sidestep the issue here with the images being public domain. Using two logos is extremely common for higher education pages—it's basically built into <a href="/wiki/Template:Infobox_university" title="Template:Infobox university">the infobox</a> to have the seal on top and a <a href="/wiki/Wordmark" title="Wordmark">wordmark</a> (sometimes, as here, with a logo) on the bottom. If that's creating copyright issues, it may be worthwhile to start a broader discussion somewhere about it; feel free to ping me if you do so. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 00:24, 27 August 2021 (UTC)

<li>For ref 76, it looks like a free credit card–required trial, so I'm not sure if that's covered by "free registration".

<li>Newspapers.com is linked in ref76, but most other refs don't have the work/publisher linked.

<p>Overall this is looking pretty good, and I am glad that you put the work in on this. I just have a few points:
</p>
<ul><li>I feel like you could expand the critical reception section, though it currently looks pretty good. There are many critics who have reviewed Rolling Stones songs, and I know Vulture.com ranked them. Perhaps this could be included.
<dl><dd>Vulture is mentioned? Some <a href="/wiki/Special:Diff/1040264445" title="Special:Diff/1040264445">content was cut</a> per comments at this FAC. --<a href="/wiki/User:TheSandDoctor" title="User:TheSandDoctor"><span style="color:#FF9933; font-weight:bold; font-family:monotype;">The</span><span style="color:#009933; font-weight:bold;">SandDoctor</span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheSandDoctor" title="User talk:TheSandDoctor"><span style="color:#009933;">Talk</span></a></sup> 17:01, 29 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>Both cover images have good FURs. I would strongly recommend editing both of the file pages and adding which cover it is that is being depicted (UK/US), as that isn't clear. I think they are sufficiently different to justify the use of both despite the NFR restrictions. The audio grab FUR is also fine, especially as it features the sitar, which is discussed in the article. I don't see the need for another photo of the band (as mentioned above), as the band members are on the covers. I can't think of any other photograph that might be appropriate except one of Jones playing the sitar (preferably performing this song), but I couldn't see one on Commons, and the one of him playing the sitar alongside Wyman pre-dates this song's release. Ping me when the file pages are tweaked and I'll sign off on this.

<p>Drenović (pronounced Drenovich) was a Bosnian Serb Chetnik leader during World War II. He started off as part of the general rebellion against the extreme nationalist Ustaše and their genocidal policies against the Serbs, but soon turned against the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans who wanted to fight the Axis occupiers. He despised Muslims and Croats, and as a Chetnik he collaborated with first the Ustaše, then the Italians and the Germans. Aged 33, he was killed in an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka in May 1944. Despite his extensive collaboration with the Axis Powers during the war, a street in Banja Luka is named after him, and within the Serb entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the <a href="/wiki/Republika_Srpska" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>, the actions of his Chetniks are celebrated and equated with those of the Partisans.

<ul><li>I'm finding myself a bit confused by the relationship between the various groups in the Bosanska Krajina uprising sections.  The Ustase and the Axis worked together, and were opposed by the Partisans.  But the role of the Chetniks is unclear - it reads like they were integral parts of the Partisans in places, but also at times outside of the Partisan organization.  My guess is that the Partisans were anti Ustase/Axis, while the Chetniks were simply pro-Serb, but it wouldn't hurt to try to clarify this.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>The Chetniks essentially fought alongside the Partisans for most of 1941, but started fighting against them from late 1941 on, and in doing so, they began collaborating with the Axis and their local proxies (the Ustase).

Please let me know if it's any less confusing. <a href="/wiki/User:Amanuensis_Balkanicus" title="User:Amanuensis Balkanicus">Amanuensis Balkanicus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amanuensis_Balkanicus" title="User talk:Amanuensis Balkanicus">talk</a>) 00:40, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I think it makes a lot more sense.  I think "A Serbian nationalist with anti-Muslim and anti-Croat views, Drenović eventually betrayed the Partisans and sided with the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, whose ideology more closely aligned with his own." helps a lot</li></ul>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>You bring up a really good point.

<ul><li>"As of 2019 a street in Banja Luka was named after Drenović, and his actions and those of his Chetniks are celebrated in the official history of World War II used within Republika Srpska.

<p>This article is about an American baseball player who tragically died two years ago from <a href="/wiki/Fentanyl" title="Fentanyl">fentanyl</a> poisoning. This article underwent the good article process back in March. After that, I did a large-scale expansion in order to reach the "comprehensive" criterion, and I tightened the prose in several places as well based on how my writing skills improved between the GA process and preparation for FAC. Once this expansion was complete, this article underwent a thorough copyedit from a member of the GOCE, and I performed several other small tweaks, mostly to the references. All feedback is appreciated, and I hope that this is an enjoyable reading experience about a man's too-short life. — <b><a href="/wiki/User:GhostRiver" title="User:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#BEBFC5">Ghost</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:GhostRiver" title="User talk:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#89CFF0">River</span></a></b> 13:45, 21 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>Two initial comments:
</p><p>1) Some more information has come out about the investigation of Eric Kay, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/32074571/prosecutors-say-former-angels-employee-asked-drug-suppliers-deliver-opioids-stadium">here's</a> one of the sources I found. I'm not sure how much information will directly relate to Skaggs, but I think it's important to comb over anyway.
</p>
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Famous_Hobo" title="User:Famous Hobo">Famous Hobo</a> I've looked over some of the recent information relating to the investigation. Most of it appears to be tangential and is primarily related to Kay, but I added some information about how MLB instituted a new opioid policy, and how the DEA later determined that fentanyl was the primary driver of Skaggs' death. — <b><a href="/wiki/User:GhostRiver" title="User:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#BEBFC5">Ghost</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:GhostRiver" title="User talk:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#89CFF0">River</span></a></b> 12:56, 30 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>2) This is more of an aesthetic choice, but I'm not a big fan of the lede image. It doesn't show Skaggs' face. I think either [File:Tyler Skaggs (28995932598) (cropped).jpg this] or <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tyler_Skaggs_-_long_toss_(48343655217)_(cropped).jpg">this</a> would be better.
</p>
<dl><dd>I have changed the lede image to one of the two that you suggested. I do like the other one, especially because it gives a good glimpse of his jersey number, so I moved it to the appropriate section. — <b><a href="/wiki/User:GhostRiver" title="User:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#BEBFC5">Ghost</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:GhostRiver" title="User talk:GhostRiver"><span style="font-family:Georgia; color:#89CFF0">River</span></a></b> 22:38, 28 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I thought this was extremely high quality when I reviewed this as a GA. A few comments, but all minor stuff:
</p>
<ul><li>”His favorite sport was basketball, and he referred to himself as "not the greatest dribbler but I can shoot".” – “His favorite sport was basketball, about which he described himself as “not the greatest dribbler” but being able to shoot.  -  Better grammatically.</li>
<li>” In 2008, his junior year of high school, Skaggs had a 1.11 earned run average (ERA), with 89 strikeouts, 44 hits allowed, and 22 walks in 63+1⁄3 innings pitched, enough to receive Player of the Year honors from the Ocean League.” – “In 2008, his junior year of high school, Skaggs was named the Ocean League’s Player of the Year after posting a 1.11 earned run average (ERA) with 89 strikeouts, 44 hits allowed, and 22 walks in 63+1⁄3 innings pitched.”</li>
<li>”As a senior the following year” – “During Skaggs’s senior year” – The way it’s worded right now, it looks like the sentence is saying the scouts were a senior.</li>
<li>”He played 10 Rookie League” – “He pitched 10 Rookie League”</li>
<li>”started in 17 games” – Don’t need in.</li>
<li>”they named Skaggs” – “the league named Skaggs”</li>
<li>Player of the Year is capitalized in the high school section, but pitcher of the year is not for 2011.  Seems like both of these should be done the same way, for consistency.</li>
<li>”Futures game, but was selected” – “Futures game but was later selected”</li>
<li>”where he pitched eight strikeouts” – “where he recorded eight strikeouts”</li>
<li>”forearm tightness, and was” – No comma needed.</li>
<li>”After pitching the third out” – “After recording the third out”</li>
<li>This is probably from a rearranging of the article, but Andrew Heaney needs to be linked in the personal life section and delinked later on.  (Corbin is fine, linked on first mention earlier.)</li>
<li>” Skaggs had planned to represent Mexico at the World Baseball Classic before his death” – The next one he could’ve represented Mexico in would be the 2021 Classic, so I would say “Skaggs had planned to represent Mexico at the 2021 World Baseball Classic.”  That way, the sentence doesn’t accidentally imply that he planned his death.</li></ul>

<p>Very little for me to pick up on here - just a few points.
</p>
<ul><li>"Panenka's name is now synonymous with that particular style of penalty kick." This assertion in the lead isn't made in the body of the article - you mention other players replicating it, but not that his name is has come to mean a style of kick (I assume that people refer to it as taking a Panenka penalty?) - could this be made explicit?</li>
<li>"The UEFA Euro 1976 Final was the third competitive fixture between West Germany and Czechoslovakia, having played one another in the 1934 and the 1958 FIFA World Cups." The second clause needs a subject - something like "the teams having played one another..."</li>
<li>" as Pollák was suspended for the final" Consider reminding the reader he'd been sent off in the semi - that was quite a few paragraphs ago.</li>
<li>"while the West Germany player was not booked." This reads slightly awkwardly to me - would 'bit' work better than 'while', or maybe just break the clause out into a separate sentence?</li>
<li>"Müller then passed to Viktor down the right wing but Maier came out to charge down the opportunity to score." I'm not clear on what 'charge down the opportunity to score' means - Maier's the goalie, so I assume this means he left the goal line to obstruct the German players, but it could be a bit clearer.</li>
<li>"All but three of UEFA's team of the tournament had featured in the final," What is a 'team of the tournament'? I assume from the context that it's a bit like a man of the match, where they choose the best 11 players and say that would be the ideal team, but I've never heard of it and I'm just guessing. If there isn't an article to link to, could this be explained in a few words?</li></ul>

I can find nothing reliable to explain it, not for that year's tournament.  You have it spot on, UEFA picked the "best" eleven from all the teams in the finals, but sadly all I have in every source I have found for 1976 is simply a declaration of that team, nothing more.

<ul><li>All footnotes and references are formatted consistently in a manner that adheres to the MOS.</li>
<li>All sources appear to be to high-quality, reliable sources.</li>
<li>I am concerned about the narrow scope of the sources. In essence, the majority of this article is sourced to statistical summaries on <i>11v11</i> or <i>RSSSF</i> and to Jonathan O'Brien's book. Nothing is wrong with either of these sources, but for a Featured quality article, I would expect a much broader range. Notably, there are no newspaper reports and therefore little to no third-party analysis of the game. Some things that I would hope and expect to see in this sort of article: who was the favourite coming into the final, did pundits feel the result was the right one, how well did the teams play, did they play with a particular style? A quick search brought up a match report in the Guardian which talks about some of these things. It is obviously tough to get German and Czech language reports, but it would be interesting to know how the result played in each country too if possible. This is a good Good article, but I am not convinced that the sourcing is anywhere near adequate for Featured status. <a href="/wiki/User:Harrias" title="User:Harrias"><span style="color:#009933">Harrias</span></a> <sup><span style="color:#009933">(he/him) •</span> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Harrias" title="User talk:Harrias"><span style="color:#009933">talk</span></a></sup> 12:00, 5 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Well it comes back to the idea of "a thorough and representative survey of the relevant literature" for the sake of "a thorough and representative survey of the relevant literature", or "a thorough and representative survey of the relevant literature" for making sure the article includes all relevant information from high quality sources. When I review sources I tend to take the latter view, more broadly, especially for individual sport matches. And in this case, particularly with the changes made above, the latter view seems met. If no further missing information can be identified, I don't see a huge reason to include other sources only for the sake of doing so. <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 23:20, 7 September 2021 (UTC)

<p>This article is about... the <a href="/wiki/Taylor_Swift" title="Taylor Swift">Taylor Swift</a> song that we did not know we wanted. Ms. Swift had never been taken seriously as a country music goody-two-shoes, until this song arrived and proved that America's Sweetheart was capable of being cooler-than-average. Though many can dismiss this song as yet another deliberate Top 40 trick from a teenybopper, this "Trouble" song has become one of Ms. Swift's biggest hits.
</p><p>After a total overhaul of the article and a GAN, I am humbled to bring this to FAC, and open to any and all suggestion regarding the article's prose and coverage. Thank you very much, <a href="/wiki/User:Ippantekina" title="User:Ippantekina">Ippantekina</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina" title="User talk:Ippantekina">talk</a>) 04:15, 20 August 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>I will post a full review for this either tomorrow or on Wednesday. Apologies for the delay. I only have one note right now. I would remove <a href="/wiki/File:Swift_performs_in_St._Louis,_Missouri_in_2013.jpg" title="File:Swift performs in St. Louis, Missouri in 2013.jpg">File:Swift performs in St. Louis, Missouri in 2013.jpg</a>. There is already an image of Swift later in the article and this one is more decorative and does not add anything further for the reader. If you want an image in this section, I would put one of either <a href="/wiki/Max_Martin" title="Max Martin">Max Martin</a> or <a href="/wiki/Shellback_(record_producer)" title="Shellback (record producer)">Shellback</a> since they are writers and producers for the song. Even if you decide to not replace this image, I still strongly encourage you to remove it. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 21:08, 23 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>The image is to comply with the upcoming DYK (which features this image). After the DYK is done, I will remove it right away. <a href="/wiki/User:Ippantekina" title="User:Ippantekina">Ippantekina</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina" title="User talk:Ippantekina">talk</a>) 07:44, 24 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Since the DYK is currently on the main page, I see no problem in waiting until it is done to remove it. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 16:27, 24 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I have a few comments about this sentence: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">It was released for digital download on October 9, 2012, as the third <a href="/wiki/Promotional_single" class="mw-redirect" title="Promotional single">promotional single</a> from <i>Red</i>; and on November 27, 2012, as the album's second <a href="/wiki/Pop_radio" class="mw-redirect" title="Pop radio">pop radio</a> single.</q> I would split it into two as it is a lot of information and I do not think the semicolon is used correctly. I would also add the record label (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Big_Machine_Records" title="Big Machine Records">Big Machine</a>) to the prose as done in the "<a href="/wiki/Shake_It_Off" title="Shake It Off">Shake It Off</a>" article.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Swift developed the song as a <a href="/wiki/Ballad" title="Ballad">ballad</a> on <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a></q>, the <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> link is not necessary as I would imagine a majority of readers are already familiar with the instrument. I would also change the ballad link to go to the <a href="/wiki/Sentimental_ballad" title="Sentimental ballad">sentimental ballad</a> article as that is more reflective of the ballad being discussed here.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>I would revise this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"><a href="/wiki/Dubstep" title="Dubstep">dubstep</a>—a genre that Swift had little knowledge of—to the song, which Swift said was</q>, to avoid repeating Swift twice in the same sentence.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>I have a comment for the quote in this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">that would make the audience "freaked out over"</q>. Something about it just seems off to me, like it does not really work in this context, and I think it would be better to just paraphrase this instead.
<ul><li>It probably had something to do with Swift's country music image, but since the <i>Billboard</i> ref does not explicitly say this, I removed the whole part.</li></ul></li>
<li>I would move the "Release" section after the "Music and lyrics" section as done in articles like "<a href="/wiki/Blank_Space" title="Blank Space">Blank Space</a>". I have seen articles with the "Release" section put before the "Music and lyrics" section (and I have done it myself), but that is in cases when the "Release" section is combined with the section about the recording process and that is not the case here.
<ul><li>Makes sense. Rearranged.</li></ul></li>
<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">In an interview with the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> in October 2013</q>, I do not think it is necessary to include the month.
<ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></li>
<li>The article makes a few references to this being a <a href="/wiki/Pop_radio" class="mw-redirect" title="Pop radio">pop radio</a> single. I was initially confused by this until I read the <a href="/wiki/Red_(Taylor_Swift_album)" title="Red (Taylor Swift album)"><i>Red</i> (Taylor Swift album)</a> which more clearly defined the <a href="/wiki/Pop_radio" class="mw-redirect" title="Pop radio">pop radio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Country_radio" title="Country radio">country radio</a> single. I think it may be worthwhile to add a footnote to clarify that Swift released separate singles for <a href="/wiki/Pop_radio" class="mw-redirect" title="Pop radio">pop radio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Country_radio" title="Country radio">country radio</a>. I am suggesting a footnote as the article already uses them and I think it would be too clunky to put right in the prose.
<ul><li>Added. Hope it clears things up.</li></ul></li>
<li>The "Release" section refers to the song being removed from Spotify. I can access it on my Spotify account so it was seemingly added back so an update to this would be beneficial as it currently ends with saying the song was removed.</li>
<li>I have another comment for this part. The "Release" section just casually mentions that Swift withdrew her catalog from Spotify without providing any context. I would briefly expand on this as some readers may end up on this page without knowing anything about Swift or this particular aspect of her career.
<ul><li>Added some explanation on Spotify.</li></ul></li>
<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">but chose to ignore the "red flags"</q>, I am not sure if red flags needs to be in quotes as it is a rather common phrase. You can also paraphrase it as warning signs or something similar.
<ul><li>Removed the quotation marks.</li></ul></li>
<li>I am uncertain about this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">"I Knew You Were Trouble" generated much discussion because it introduced the genre to a wider audience of mainstream pop, which had been "sonically conservative for the past half-decade"</q>. Britney Spears had already released "<a href="/wiki/Hold_It_Against_Me" title="Hold It Against Me">Hold It Against Me</a>" in 2011 and that had a dubstep breakdown and was commercially successful. This part reads like "I Knew You Were Trouble" was the one song that broke dubstep into mainstream pop, and I do not think that is true (per the example I mentioned and I am sure others).
<ul><li>While it may be factually incorrect, this is directly framed within the opinion of a <i>LA Times</i> critic. I think it should be fine as long as there is appropriate attribution.
<ul><li>Thank you for the explanation. You are correct. This part is not only attributed with a citation, but the prose also clarifies that this is one critic's opinion so it should be okay. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 14:52, 25 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">became one of the dubstep-influenced songs from its time that managed to age well</q>, I would be more specific than "from its time" as the current wording is rather vague.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>For the third paragraph of the "Critical reception" section, I would vary the sentence structure as it is currently rather repetitive, which makes it less engaging for the reader.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>I do not think "dismissive" in this part, felt that the dubstep sound was dismissive, really makes sense.
<ul><li>Reworded.</li></ul></li>
<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">which overshadowed Swift's lyrical narrative</q>, I would just say "lyrics". The phrasing "lyrical narrative" just seems unnecessarily wordy.
<ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>I would remove this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Carney had starred as <a href="/wiki/Peter_Parker" class="mw-redirect" title="Peter Parker">Peter Parker</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> musical <i><a href="/wiki/Spider-Man:_Turn_Off_the_Dark" title="Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark">Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</a></i></q>, as it is not connected to the song or the music video.</li></ul>

<ul><li>I have a comment about this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">as "just as chaotic as the feeling was when [she] wrote it"</q>. The quote does not really make sense here as it cuts off a word. In the citation, it is "sounds just as chaotic as the feeling was when I wrote it" and without the "sounds", it is not really clear what Swift is describing as chaotic.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Would it be possible to revise this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">it "ultimately gets absorbed into [Swift's] own aesthetic", resulting in a radio-friendly song that retained Swift's authentic, "sharply crafted" songwriting</q>, without repeating "Swift's" twice in the same sentence?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I would revise this sentence, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The music video for "I Knew You Were Trouble" was directed by <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Mandler" title="Anthony Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>.</q>, so it is in the active tense rather than the passive tense.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>After reading this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"><i>Rolling Stone</i> labeled Swift's look as "<a href="/wiki/Punk_fashion" title="Punk fashion">punk</a>".</q>, I went to the article to find the quote and I do not think it is used correctly. Correct me if I am wrong, but the "punk" quote is taken from the article's title and that does not clearly connect it with her look. Later on, the article describes the video as having "punk-rock decadence" so this seems to be more about the events in the music video.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"><i><a href="/wiki/Marie_Claire" title="Marie Claire">Marie Claire</a></i> commented that this "edgy" look</q>, I would paraphrase "edgy" as the one-word quote is not particularly useful in this context.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I think the "edgy" quote explains the author's comment on Swift's image later in the sentence; plus I don't know if "edgy" can be paraphrased so that it conveys the exact meaning, given that the word has crept into public use.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>That should be fine then. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:08, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>This part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Swift speaks in a monologue</q>, is not correct, and I would either use "delivers a monologue" and "gives a monologue" instead.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I admit that it has been a while since I watched this music video, but I got confused by this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">This love interest exhibits behaviors that are unreliable</q>. There are seemingly multiple love interests, but the distinction between the one played by Carney and this other one is not clear. Could you clarify this for me?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>There is only one love interest (Carney)!</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Then why say "this love interest"? That wording implies to me that there are more than one as "this" seems to be specifying one from another. I would just change that part. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:09, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>In the last paragraph of the "Music video" section, you only say the publications in the prose (i.e. <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"><i>Spin</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Vulture_(website)" class="mw-redirect" title="Vulture (website)">Vulture</a></i> noted similarities</q>), while the previous section also use the writers' names. I would add the names here for consistency if known. If they are not known, I would say something like a <i>Rolling Stone</i> writer. This is also true for the "punk" <i>Rolling Stone</i> quote earlier in this section.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised, but kept unknown authors out; I think "a writer from ..." is kinda redundant.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Yahoo! found the storyline</q>, link <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> and I would encourage you to archive the link (although the second part is not required for this FAC).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Melinda Newman agreed</q>, attribute what publication Melinda Newman is writing for as this is her first mention in the article.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Revised.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I would re-examine the prose for the  last paragraph of the "Music video" section. It has a lot of great content, but it can read like a list at times. I would think about varying the sentence structure and trying to make it flow more cohesively.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Rewritten.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>In the "Credits and personnel" section, I would remove the <a href="/wiki/Songwriter" title="Songwriter">writer</a> link as I believe a majority of readers would already understand the concept.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>This is probably a silly question so apologies in advance, but does the upcoming rerecording of the song need its own section or its own infobox? There's very little information about it other than it is going to be released. I could see this being folded into the "Release" section with the infobox removed. If further information about this rerecording is released, then a separate section can also be made again, but it just seems unnecessary to me.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I had a discussion with other Taylor Swift WikiProject members, and it seems they want to keep the section.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It is not a huge issue to me. I really do not see the value in this section, but it would be best to see how other reviews see it. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:07, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I decided to post my further comments much earlier than expected. I believe this should be all of my comments. I have primarily focused on the prose, but I have a few comments about the citations at the end. Let me know if you have any questions. Once my above comments are addressed, I will re-read the article and will very likely support it at that point.

<ul><li>So first I gotta ask, is it worth mentioning the version of the song with the screaming goat? I don't mean that as a joke; when I saw the article was on FAC, I wanted to see if it was included. If you need a good source, how's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://people.com/pets/no-one-loved-the-screaming-goat-videos-more-than-taylor-swift/">People.com</a>? It could just be a sentence in the "music video" section.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I am uncertain if the goat remix is that relevant, given that it was a temporary reaction to the song and has apparently died down.. 03:11, 29 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Even if the reaction died down, it was still part of the cultural legacy of the song. ♫ <a href="/wiki/User:Hurricanehink" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> (<small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hurricanehink" title="User talk:Hurricanehink">talk</a></small>)  13:47, 2 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>When was the song recorded?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I looked through the album booklet and couldn't find such information.

<ul><li>"While Swift promoted Red as a country music album and released singles to country radio, "I Knew You Were Trouble" was the first single from Red not promoted to country radio." - this seems pretty important, more than just sticking in some note.</li>
<li><i> "I Knew You Were Trouble" was released as a single in the U.K. on December 10, 2012[30] and in Italy on January 11, 2013.</i> - so what does it mean to be released as a single in those countries? The article says how it charted in multiple countries, not just these two.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I am pretty sure the song was released worldwide; I added these two countries because there are clear-cut sources for the release dates, unlike others. <a href="/wiki/User:Ippantekina" title="User:Ippantekina">Ippantekina</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina" title="User talk:Ippantekina">talk</a>) 03:11, 29 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li><i>While Roberts acknowledged that critics could dismiss the dubstep as conceit, it was justifiable for Swift—"the pop moment"—to experiment with mainstream trends.</i> - I don't get the grammar or meaning of "the pop moment" here. The quote seems out of place.</li></ul>

<ul><li>There is nothing about the song's key, tempo, chord progression. It's in F#/Gb major or D#/Eb minor for what it's worth.</li></ul>

<p>I said I would leave some comments here but unfortunately I don't have much time anymore. This is not a full "source review" but here are some comments:
</p>
<ul><li>ref 21 "American Broadcasting Company" shouldn't be italicized. It's also under <a href="/wiki/ABC_News" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> website so I would write that instead of American Broadcasting Company.</li>
<li>ref 81 url-status=dead</li>
<li>per <a href="/wiki/MOS:CONFORMTITLE" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:CONFORMTITLE">MOS:CONFORMTITLE</a> bullet 4, stuff like 'Red' or Billboard should be italicized in citation titles whether the source does or not.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>ref 27 I don't know if a podcast transcript that has "not been reviewed prior to publication" meets the high-quality sources requirement.</li>
<li>ref 30 is there a better source than Popjustice/one closer to December 10 than October 29 article date? Release dates could change in a month's time.</li>
<li>ref 81 I might cite <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/news/one-direction-disney-awards/">Capital FM</a> or <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/gomez-bieber-win-top-disney-gongs-29229543.html">Irish Independent</a></i> instead</li>
<li>no issues about other sources</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>ref 2 "and co-produced it with Nathan Chapman, her longtime collaborator" not in source</li>
<li>ref 3 this sentence is presented as a fact, but is citing a review, which is one person's opinion.</li>
<li>ref 21 date is 2012, not 2013</li>
<li>ref 27 it might be helpful to specify a location where the statement can be verified. Either cite a timestamp from the audio version instead or use the quote= parameter. I don't know what to look for here.</li>

<p>This article is about the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> game show <i>Greed</i>, which was considered to be the network's answer to the success of ABC's <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_(American_game_show)" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a></i>.

Why "primary announcer" instead of just "announcer"? Where there are other people who did announcements on the show?</li>
<li>I have two comments for this sentence: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The game consisted of a team of contestants who answered a series of multiple-choice questions for a potential prize of up to $2,000,000.</q> The first being I believe this should be all in present tense as it is referencing things that happen in the show. Second, the "The game" starter reads a little off to me. I would use a different word choice.</li>
<li>I would reword this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">although others believed <i>Greed</i> to be the more intriguing and</q>, to this, <span style="color:blue">although others believed <i>Greed</i> was the more intriguing and</span>. It is a super minor and nitpick-y thing I know, but I think it just reads better that way.</li>
<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">After all six submit an answer, the answer is revealed</q>, I would avoid repeating "answer" in such close proximity if possible.</li>
<li>I have two comments for this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">consisting of a <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_XK_(X100)" title="Jaguar XK (X100)">Jaguar XK8</a> convertible and $25,000 cash (approximately $100,000 total value)</q>. Would it be possible to move both citations to the end of the sentence? I just find the current placement to hinder readability somewhat. If not, then maybe the approximate value can be made a note instead. My second comment is about the value. Is this referencing the value at the time of the show's release? Would it be beneficial to directly say it. If it makes the prose cumbersome, making this a footnote could be helpful.</li>
<li>These two sentences, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Team winnings of $500,000 or more were paid as annuities. Some travel and accommodations were provided by priceline.com.</q>, do not have a citation.</li>

<li>This is more of a clarification question. Do we have any behind-the-scenes information about <i>Super Greed</i>? Like why the changes in format occurred?</li>
<li>I have a question about the "Production" section's structure. It seems a little odd to mention the show's cancelation and its attempted revival and reruns in the middle rather than the end. The final two paragraphs seem to focus more on the show's production and I would put that information before the parts on the cancelation to have it read more chronologically.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Thank you for addressing everything and for checking for further information about <i>Super Greed</i>. I would not be surprised if this information was just internal with the network and companies involved at the time. I <b>support</b> this FAC for promotion based on the prose.

<p>We covered so much on the previous nomination; it seems the major thing I hadn't struck by the time it was withdrawn was that I felt the critical reception section was missing possible good content. I went through the refs quickly again and here's my comments so far:
</p>
<ul><li><i>Toronto Star</i> articles on ProQuest via The Wikipedia Library are sometimes messed up; the page number for fn 79 is not actually 1. Luckily I have access to the images of the physical newspaper through my university's access to ProQuest, so I can verify that the article is  on page A37 and was written by <a href="/wiki/Antonia_Zerbisias" title="Antonia Zerbisias">Antonia Zerbisias</a>. The ProQuest id to the document is 1345366464 (docview/1345366464) in case you'd like the change that as well.</li></ul>

<ul><li>fn 61 can you translate what it says like a specific quote that proves a <i>Greed</i> version existed?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>So, I will be the first to admit that I don't know a word of Arabic. However, Google Translate did provide this line from the citation: "the program shown on the “LBC” screen, which is greedy, “Oh killer, you killed” and indicates from the first moment that it develops the side of greed." LBC also refers to the <a href="/wiki/Lebanese_Broadcasting_Corporation" class="mw-redirect" title="Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation">Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation</a>, which would seem to specify Lebanon. Finally, the article includes an image of <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Ghanem" title="Marcel Ghanem">Marcel Ghanem</a> on a set that resembles other countries' versions of the show. While the computer translation isn't great, this would seem to me to prove that a version of the show did in fact exist in Lebanon. --<a href="/wiki/User:Bcschneider53" title="User:Bcschneider53">Bcschneider53</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bcschneider53" title="User talk:Bcschneider53">talk</a>) 17:17, 28 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>Another joint venture from the itinerant repeat nominator Gog the Mild and the Scottish history expert Girth Summit. Charles I was king of England and Scotland, as two entirely separate matters. When the English chopped his head off they didn't consult the Scots. So when the Scots crowned Charles II it was as king of Britain (not Scotland). Which, with massive understatement, could be described as a provocation. In short order Oliver Cromwell was leading an English army across the border. The campaign was hard fought, but ended with the whole of Scotland subjugated. OK, in some ways it ended with Charles and the Scots' army going down to defeat in Worcester. Which part of Scotland is Worcester in, you ask? Read the article.

<p>As an older Englishman I already know that Charles II was a king - but for younger foreigners would the first sentence be improved as something like "In 1650 the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England" title="Commonwealth of England">English Commonwealth</a>'s <a href="/wiki/New_Model_Army" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a> invaded <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, intending to forestall a Scottish army led by <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" title="Charles II of England">King Charles II</a> invading England."&#160;? And that sentence could perhaps be its own paragraph (maybe add another sentence with result later) as the next sentence is a flashback?
</p>
<dl><dd>So my concern about calling him King Charles II is that, at the point in his life that we're talking about here, the question of whether he was king and where he was king of is somewhat contested. He was not yet King of England, and while the Scots had proclaimed him "King of Great Britain, France and Ireland", it's obviously not clear that they had the authority to do so. Plus he hadn't been crowned yet (that happened in January 1651). We can't possibly unpack all of that in the first sentence, and so I personally think it's better to refer to him as "Charles II" (which is his COMMONNAME) in the opening sentence, and then explain things more fully later on in the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Girth_Summit" title="User:Girth Summit"><span style="font-family:Impact;color:#006400;">Girth</span>&#160;<span style="font-family:Impact;color:#4B0082;">Summit</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Girth_Summit" title="User talk:Girth Summit"><sub style="font-family:Segoe print;color:blue;"> (blether)</sub></a> 11:38, 22 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>And would it be better to use a different tense next like
"From 1642 to 1648 <a href="/wiki/Cavaliers" class="mw-redirect" title="Cavaliers">Royalists</a>, loyal to <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I of England</a>, had fought <a href="/wiki/Roundheads" class="mw-redirect" title="Roundheads">Parliamentarians</a> in the <a href="/wiki/First_English_Civil_War" title="First English Civil War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_English_Civil_War" title="Second English Civil War">Second English Civil Wars</a>"&#160;?
</p>
<dl><dd>This wouldn't be wrong, but it's not clear to me that it would be an improvement - I'll see what GtM thinks. <a href="/wiki/User:Girth_Summit" title="User:Girth Summit"><span style="font-family:Impact;color:#006400;">Girth</span>&#160;<span style="font-family:Impact;color:#4B0082;">Summit</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Girth_Summit" title="User talk:Girth Summit"><sub style="font-family:Segoe print;color:blue;"> (blether)</sub></a> 11:38, 22 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Other reviewers would certainly then ask why the article was written in two tenses. Currently we have picked one and used it consistently. <a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Gog_the_Mild" title="User talk:Gog the Mild">talk</a>) 16:09, 24 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Rather an unwelcome change for a Gog article – the bad guys won! (Still, the good guys won ten years later, as you mention at the end.) As far as I can tell, knowing little about this period, the content is well balanced, and the sources look excellent to my layman's eye. I offer some minor comments on the prose, but very few, as the article is excellently constructed and beautifully written:
</p>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">In 1650 Scotland was actively raising an army</span> – can one raise an army passively?
<dl><dd>Changed to 'rapidly' - any better?
<dl><dd>Per Eddie's review above, I see that I actually changed it to 'paridly'. Oops.</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">the English were willing to fight to defend the republic</span> – was the term "republic" used at the time? Question asked from a position of complete ignorance, but the word seemed vaguely anachronistic/parachronistic to me)
<dl><dd>I believe the word was used at the time (and there's the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic" title="Dutch Republic">Dutch Republic</a> too).</dd></dl></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Widely used in the scholarly literature. I could provide quotes or point you towards analyses of Milton's or Cromwell's political views if you would like. <a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Gog_the_Mild" title="User talk:Gog the Mild">talk</a>) 16:19, 24 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">the authority to approve all of the king's councillors …. all of the King's subjects in Scotland</span> – superfluous "of"s here, <i>à l'américaine</i>.
<dl><dd>Hmm. Looked alright to me, but I bow to all of your pronouncements on matters of prose. :P</dd></dl></li></ul>
<dl><dd>Afterthought: I am painfully aware that attempting the capitalisation, or not, of royal job titles is the road to insanity, but I can't help noticing the king/King in this bit of the text. I most decidedly do not press the point.
<dl><dd>Fiddled with caps throughout.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">bitterly divided on whether or not to ratify its terms</span> – does the "or not" add anything useful?
<dl><dd>Gone</dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Exasperated by Charles' duplicity</span> – strange form of the possessive, where one would expect the usual "Charles's"
<dl><dd>True - fixed</dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Scotland was actively rearming</span> – actively, again. Seems an odd word.
<dl><dd>actively --&gt; rapidly</dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">They pressured Thomas Fairfax</span> – is pressuring someone different from pressing him?
<dl><dd>Changed</dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">launch a preemptive attack</span> – you hyphenate "pre-emptive" earlier (as does the OED)
<dl><dd>changed</dd></dl></li>
<li><span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">so as to enable</span> – the first two words seem otiose
<dl><dd>I don't know what otiose means (sounds like a brand of breakfast serial), but changed regardless.</dd></dl></li></ul>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Because the Scots declared on 5 February 1650, Charles arrived in Scotland on 23 June, but wasn't crowned until 1 January 1651.</dd>

<ul><li>"Under pressure from the English to withdraw their forces now the war was over," This threw me a bit as I had not realised that the Scots kept their forces in England against the wishes of the English.

<ul><li>Portrait of Charles I. I think you should say by Anthony van Dyck</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Why?

<ul><li>"the New Model Army purged Parliament and established the Rump Parliament. This had Charles tried for treason against the English people; he was executed on 30 January 1649,[13] and the republican Commonwealth was created". "This had Charles tried" is unclear and colloquial. How about "the New Model Army purged Parliament and established the Rump Parliament, which appointed a court to try Charles for treason against the English people. He was convicted and on 39 January 1649 he was executed.[13] On 19 May the country became a republic as the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth of England</a>.</li></ul>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Neither. Worcester didn't have a military garrison. They just marched down the street, as they had in all the other towns they passed through. Worcester only became important with hindsight as the Scots paused and were so were later brought to battle there.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hi there, thanks for your comments. However, there arent't official sources for these, or news that thoroughly mention traffic patterns and stuff. The Land Transport Authority doesnt give detailed information like passenger patterns in the station and stuff. Whats on the page is what I can get from available sources.--<a href="/wiki/User:ZKang123" title="User:ZKang123">ZKang123</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ZKang123" title="User talk:ZKang123">talk</a>) 06:27, 21 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>OK I have never been to Singapore but it seems from casual research that the station must by law have an "emergency response plan" but that Singapore does not have a freedom of information act - so I understand your difficulty in getting hold of official info. But maybe if you live nearby you can get some of the above - for example the existing pics are not bad but if convenient it would be nice to have close pics of more of the art such as "Universal Language" which sounds interesting. <a href="/wiki/User:Chidgk1" title="User:Chidgk1">Chidgk1</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Chidgk1" title="User talk:Chidgk1">talk</a>) 10:20, 21 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ah, but here we dont have FOP for 2D artworks, so I cant really show any close-up of the artwork (I do have some shots of the floor tiles, but I dont think they are worthy of upload due to the weird angle). Besides, I dont think its necessary to flood the page with too many pictures.</dd>
<dd>Also we do have a layout diagram but there will be some trouble recreating it without violating copyright.--<a href="/wiki/User:ZKang123" title="User:ZKang123">ZKang123</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ZKang123" title="User talk:ZKang123">talk</a>) 10:26, 21 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Oh OK I don't know much about copyright. An academic search such as "Google Scholar" on the station name may get more info.

<dl><dd>I find such info to be more useful on mainspace MRT pages.

But I do believe that you would be able to add more to the article if you dig around a bit more. At the moment I don't think the article is comprehensive enough to be featured.

<dl><dd>Well, from the metro stations FAs I came across (like <a href="/wiki/Aldwych_tube_station" title="Aldwych tube station">Aldwych tube station</a>), they don't go into detail on shops and stuff.

<p>Some grammar and small comments&#160;:)
</p><p>a) "Sun simultaneously wanted commuters to enjoy his work." &gt;&gt; This makes no sense without another clause. E.g: "..., while also..."
</p><p>b) "Derived from the station's role as a "gateway" for arts and culture in the area, he hoped to explore an "objective" and "pure form of expression" that connect to all cultures." &gt;&gt; ... that connected to all ...
</p><p>c) "The work intends to connect commuters to their immediate environment while considering the station's functionality and environment." &gt;&gt; Repetition of environment should go. 
</p><p>d) "In creating the artwork, Baet used pencil and paper to sketch rubbings, and he used plasticine to capture moulds." &gt;&gt; Delete "he used."
</p><p>e) "By using white for the work, Baet intended to avoid distracting commuters and hoped to make audiences comfortable" &gt;&gt; Audience probably isn't the right word here. Maybe: "... and hoped instead to make them comfortable."
</p><p>f) "These seats, while functional and practical, are designed to improve commuters' experience on the line." &gt;&gt; I feel like the practical aspect of the seats is what makes the commuters' experience better, which makes the it seem off.
</p><p>g) The first paragraph in the public art section should talk more about the fact that they are lanterns and less in the abstract.

<ul><li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Located in Dhoby Ghaut, Museum Planning Area, at the eastern end of Orchard Road shopping belt</q> - I would suggest something like "Located at the eastern end of Orchard Road shopping belt in Dhoby Ghaut, Museum Planning Area". By the way, is Museum Planning Area a legally defined census division or just a neighbourhood?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">as part of the original MRT line extension</q> - I think you should give a little context, maybe a few words, about the original MRT line in the lead. Many outsiders wouldn't know offhand that the original MRT line was split into the East West and North South lines. Furthermore, it may read better if you said "as part of an extension of the original MRT line".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Since 4 November 1989, the North South line serves the station</q> - this should be "the North South line has served the station"</li></ul>
<p>History:
</p>
<ul><li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">from the Novena to Outram Park stations</q> - For consistency, this should be either "from Novena to Outram Park stations" or "from the Novena station to the Outram Park station".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Before work began, tenants of Amber Mansions had had to move out to make way for the construction of this station</q> - This wording is awkward. Something like "Before work began, tenants of Amber Mansions were compelled to relocate for the station's construction" may be better.</li>
<li>Shouldn't the last sentence of the 2nd paragraph, about land acquisition beginning in 1978, be relocated to the beginning of the section? Especially if the land was acquired for the MRT.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Due to the station's soft marine clay</q> - <i>The ground</i> has soft marine clay.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">near Cathay Cinema</q> - I presume this was right next to the station site?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">the three pieces of timber, intended to support the crane,</q> - Either the commas can be removed (i.e. "Investigations revealed that three pieces of timber, intended to support the crane, were not properly fastened and inadequate in providing support") or the "the" before "three pieces of timber" could be removed. If you add commas, then it indicates that the crane fell because there were three pieces of timber supporting it, which failed. If you remove "the", then it indicates the crane was supported by at least three pieces of timber, of which three failed.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> in September that year</q> - This should be "That September".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> the system operational split on 4 November 1989</q> - Like I said for the lead, this needs a little clarification, as not all people know about the split.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> The NEL station was constructed with considerable difficulty</q> - This could be rephrased to "The NEL station's construction was considerably difficult".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> Motion detectors had to be set up to monitor the effects of the construction</q> - Presumably to prevent <a href="/wiki/Settlement_(structural)" title="Settlement (structural)">settlement (structural)</a>?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> The MRL was later confirmed to serve from this station to Stadium station in November 1999</q> - This sounds strange to me. Was the MRL routing finalised between these two stations, or was it just that the MRL would serve some stops between these two stations? Would the MRL just run between these two stations, or was this part of a longer line?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> support was needed to keep the underpass stable</q> - I would suggest active voice for this sentence, e.g. "the underpass was stabilised"</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk"> began operations</q> - I would just say "began operating" or even "opened".</li></ul>
<p>Station details
</p>
<ul><li>I'd recommend splitting the info about the Jewish cemetery into its own sentence.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The station name, Dhoby Ghaut</q> - Just wondering which language this is in.</li>
<li>For that matter, what does "walking distance" mean in this context? What is the distance you're using to determine which landmarks are being mentioned? (I know these are in the sources, but it would be helpful to mention something like "within a few hundred metres".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The official station code is NS24/NE6/CC1</q> - Should this be "The official codes are"?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">the next adjacent station being Bras Basah station</q> - This is redundant as "next" and "adjacent" mean the same thing.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">and increases</q> - There are a few issues with this. First, grammatically this should be "increasing". Second, the headway is 5-6 minutes off-peak and 2-3 minutes peak; the <i>frequency</i> would be 10-12 trains per hour off-peak and 20-30 tph peak. So this would need to be clarified, as the headways would decrease if the frequency increases.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">180 metres (590 ft) long</q> - This should be "180-metre (590 ft)-long", i.e. {{convert|180|m|ft|adj=on}}-long</li>
<li>I assume the NSL station is the shallowest. I also assume the five levels include concourses, but it would be good to clarify this. (On an unrelated note, it's a shame the station layouts were removed as they would've been useful here.)</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">until they were surpassed by Bras Basah station on the CCL in 2010</q> - I suggest "until 2010, when Bras Basah station on the CCL opened".</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The station itself is not designated as a Civil Defence shelter</q> - Are MRT stations typically CD shelters? If so, then this should be rephrased to "Unlike many other MRT stations, the station..." If not, then see my next point.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">an underground car park underneath the ten-storey tower are designated shelters instead</q> - First, "are designated shelters" should be changed to "is a designated shelter", as the car park is a single thing. Second, if MRT stations aren't typically CD shelters, then I would move this to the beginning and rephrase this as something like "An underground car park underneath the ten-storey tower is designated as a Civil Defence shelter, though the station itself is not designated as such."</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The station also has wheelchair-friendly facilities for the disabled</q> - This is also redundant as "wheelchair-friendly" necessarily means the facility accommodates the disabled.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The NSL station has been upgraded to include lifts, ramps and dedicated toilets for the disabled</q> - But it was not built with accessible facilities?</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs</q> - What type of <a href="/wiki/Tactile_paving" title="Tactile paving">tactile paving</a> is this? It sounds like <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tactile_paving_in_a_Mass_Rapid_Transit_station_in_Singapore_-_20131105.jpg">this type</a> (though that image doesn't look like DBG). I would link <a href="/wiki/Tactile_paving" title="Tactile paving">tactile paving</a> as well.</li></ul>
<p>Public art 
</p>
<ul><li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">A mobile sculpture Lantern of Music</q> - I would remove "a", which is unnecessary as this is a specific named sculpture.</li>
<li>I went over the "Public art" section in my previous reviews of the article, and it doesn't look too different from before. I'll address this later and see if anything significant still sticks out.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this looks good. Coverage-wise, there may be some information like retail presence (which Chidgk1 mentions above) that could be added to the design sections. But I disagree with them on the inclusion of other things like COVID airflow and advertising, as that may get a little <i>too</i> granular for FA. <a href="/wiki/User:Epicgenius" title="User:Epicgenius">Epicgenius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Epicgenius" title="User talk:Epicgenius">talk</a>) 14:06, 9 September 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>To be honest the nomenclature of the eurypterid clades is strange. I don't see why the superfamilies ending in -<i>acea</i> do not hold priority. The case with Mixopteroidea vs. Carcinosomatoidea is also more complicated than needs to be explored in detail in this article; though if it can be phrased in another way I welcome suggestions. <i>Mixopteroidea</i> (in the form Mixopteracea) was used before <i>Carcinosomatoidea</i> and is the oldest superfamily-level name of the group (coined by Caster and Kjellesvig-Waering in 1964). Apparently, however, the authority for superfamilies derives from the authority of the type family, which means that <i>Carcinosomatoidea</i>, first used only in recent years, is recognised as coined by Størmer in 1934, despite Størmer only having named the Carcinosomat<i>idae</i>. This in turn means that <i>Carcinosomatoidea</i> also gets priority over <i>Mixopteroidea</i>, since <i>Mixopteroidea</i> derives from <i>Mixopteridae</i>, coined by Caster and Kjellesvig-Waering in 1955. <a href="/wiki/User:Ichthyovenator" title="User:Ichthyovenator">Ichthyovenator</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ichthyovenator" title="User talk:Ichthyovenator">talk</a>) 23:56, 24 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Replaced the second 1955.

<ul><li>"Foerste also noted that the fossils of M. welchi were not morphologically distinct enough from other eurypterids to differentiate it, with its earlier age instead serving as the main distinction of the genus and species." No change needed but is difference in age alone considered enough to distinguish species? Why could it not be long-lived species?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You are correct that difference in age is not enough to properly distinguish species. <i>M. welchi</i> was based on very fragmentary fossils which at this time were determined to not contain any features that allows for secure differentiation from other eurypterids, but it was kept as a distinct species since a lack of distinguishing features also means that it did not preserve any particular distinguishing traits of any other species (if that makes sense), so it could not be assigned to any known species at this time either. The difference in age then serves as something like a provisional distinguishing feature since no previously known species lived at the same time as <i>M. welchi</i>. Geographical and temporal differences are sometimes used in this way for poorly preserved fossil animals: the plesiosaur <i><a href="/wiki/Scanisaurus" title="Scanisaurus">Scanisaurus</a></i>, for instance, is poorly known from fossils and the known fragments does not allow for differentiation from other plesiosaurs of its family, but its geographical location (Sweden) is unique. This usually only goes for species named decades or centuries ago, as scientists today are reluctant to name new species based on fragmentary fossils, even if the time period or geographical location are unique. <a href="/wiki/User:Ichthyovenator" title="User:Ichthyovenator">Ichthyovenator</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ichthyovenator" title="User talk:Ichthyovenator">talk</a>) 21:39, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

For some reason, I read this sentence as saying the same critics who praised Carey's voice also disliked the non-concert scenes, which makes the overall reviews seem more mixed than positive. I think a clearer separation would help.
<ul><li>I've attempted to split it.</li></ul></li>
<li>I have a question for this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">The video spent two years on the United States music video chart</q>.

<ul><li>Apologies in advance as this is likely a stupid question.

<ul><li>In this case, "music video" means not-a-film video, but I've changed it to "best-selling video albums" to hopefully make it clearer.

<li>I have two comments about this sentence: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Despite not having toured, the show established Carey as a capable live performer and quashed notions by critics that her voice was manufactured in a studio.</q> First, I do not think it is entirely grammatically correct. The beginning phrase (i.e. "Despite not having toured") is linked to the beginning of the next part (i.e. "the show") and not Carey. Also, I think this part seems a little out of order and can be expanded on further. From my understanding (and I can be wrong), this idea of Carey being a studio artist is why lead to her doing the <i><a href="/wiki/MTV_Unplugged" title="MTV Unplugged">MTV Unplugged</a></i> concert and this. It might be better to start this paragraph with this information and how she did not tour either of her first two albums. Further context would provide a clearer picture here.

<ul><li>Unlinked. I wrote the sections in different order so that may be why I forgot to check them :P

<li>For this part, <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">viewed Carey's rendition of "Without You" as the musical highlight</q>, I am not sure "musical" is needed. It just made me question if they had highlights from other categories.
<ul><li>Their indication of "Without You" as the best performance/song of the concert was in the context of them not liking the other <i>songs</i>, not necessarily the other <i>scenes</i> so I think "musical highlight" is correctly specific. We don't know if it was their favorite part of the whole video.
<ul><li>Thank you for the explanation. That makes sense to me. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:09, 20 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>It seems like the reviews in the "Critical response" section are all from the time this was released (but please correct me if I am wrong as I have not done a deep dive on the sources as this point). Have there been any retrospective reviews or articles about this? I would be rather surprised if this was the case as this seemingly occupies an important point in Carey's career. That being said, I am sure the rather generic title does not help with locating sources.
<ul><li>I couldn't locate any sources. It is kind of odd that there hasn't been but it is a Mariah Carey video album, and there are generally a lot less sources than one for Madonna, for example. Hopefully excerpts from Carey's memoir suffices as contemporary information/stuff/relevance on the topic.
<ul><li>Thank you for the response. I could not find any more contemporary sources either. This probably got lost in the shuffle of the albums in terms of retrospective articles. I also just do not see a lot of retrospective comments on video albums in general, as you have already said above. The excerpts from Carey's memoir are very good and I am glad that you included them here. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 04:09, 20 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Bold of you to go for FA without getting it to GA level first! Anyway, let's delve into this.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/File:HereIsMariahCarey.jpg" title="File:HereIsMariahCarey.jpg">File:HereIsMariahCarey.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:Boris_Aronson_The_Firstborn_Pyramid_1958.png" title="File:Boris Aronson The Firstborn Pyramid 1958.png">File:Boris Aronson The Firstborn Pyramid 1958.png</a>, and <a href="/wiki/File:Here_Is_Mariah_Carey_set_piece.png" title="File:Here Is Mariah Carey set piece.png">File:Here Is Mariah Carey set piece.png</a> all have appropriate FURs.
<ul><li>Good to hear.</li></ul></li>
<li>"of which the video was commissioned to" reads awkwardly, maybe "intended to" or "meant to" would work better?
<ul><li>Reworded to "which Columbia Records commissioned the video to promote".</li></ul></li>
<li>I'm guessing "quash notions" was supposed to be "squash notions", but that doesn't sound very formal. You'd be better off with something like "debunk", "disprove", or even "refute".
<ul><li>Changed to "disprove".</li></ul></li>
<li>Unlink "fan club", "act", "park bench", and "porch" per WP:OVERLINK when those already are commonly recognized terms
<ul><li>Unlinked all except "act".</li></ul></li>
<li>All but two sentences from the second paragraph of "Production" start with "the", which feels repetitive.
<ul><li>Reworded so now only two start with "the".</li></ul></li>
<li>Whether this video's airdate was Thanksgiving or not seems rather minor compared to it happening on November 25, 1993. Unless it was specifically chosen to air on that date because it was a holiday, I'd remove the Thanksgiving bit. Same goes for debuting right after a <i>Home Alone</i> broadcast.
<ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></li>
<li>It seems odd to only italicize "Daily News" from <i>New York Daily News</i>.
<ul><li>The article <a href="/wiki/New_York_Daily_News" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a> doesn't italicize "New York".</li></ul></li>
<li>Contrary to what placing "Critical response" and "Commercial performance" under a collective header implies, whether critics like something is a separate matter entirely from how many copies it sells. You therefore should scrap the "Reception" heading and let these stand on their own.
<ul><li>Separated them.</li></ul></li>
<li>When first mentioning <a href="/wiki/Chris_Nickson" title="Chris Nickson">Chris Nickson</a>, you forgot to include his first name. Don't simply assume all readers will automatically know who that is just by reading a surname.
<ul><li>He was previously named but I forgot to add his first name to the sentence which now introduces him. Thanks for pointing this out.</li></ul></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://variety.com/1993/tv/reviews/mariah-carey-3-1200434203/">This</a> isn't by any chance written by the same Adam Sandler who went onto star in many movies after serving as a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member, is it?
<ul><li>Hm...</li></ul></li>
<li>Not sure it's appropriate to include YouTube links to performances of each track within "External links"
<ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Never heard of this album, and since I only know Mrs. Carey by name as well as the all-time Christmas hit, I hope my review would be as objective as possible.
</p>
<ul><li>"Carey performs ten songs at the theater" → should this be in the past tense?
<ul><li>Because the video exists in the present, I believe it is supposed to be written in the present tense. The sentence is referring to her performing in the video, not the filming at the theatre. The video exists in the present, the filming does not, if that makes sense. "She performs ten songs at the theater [during the video]" makes more sense than "she performed ten songs at the theater [during the video]".
<ul><li>Thank you for your explanation. <a href="/wiki/User:Ippantekina" title="User:Ippantekina">Ippantekina</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina" title="User talk:Ippantekina">talk</a>) 02:52, 24 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>"Carey is accompanied at various times by a band" same concern
<ul><li>During the video, it isn't that she <i>was</i> accompanied at various times by a band—she <i>is</i> accompanied at various times by a band. (if that makes sense) Per <a href="/wiki/MOS:TENSE" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:TENSE">MOS:TENSE</a>, articles should generally be written in present tense.
<ul><li>I think you could reword it so that it is clear that we are talking about the video and not the concert(s). <a href="/wiki/User:Ippantekina" title="User:Ippantekina">Ippantekina</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina" title="User talk:Ippantekina">talk</a>) 02:52, 24 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Reworded/reorganized.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>"On video album charts published by Billboard and the Official Charts Company, respectively, Here Is Mariah Carey peaked at number four in the United States and spent six weeks at number one in the United Kingdom" I think this can be reworded to be less clunky; i.e. "on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> chart and the U.K. Official Charts Company chart"
<ul><li>Attempted to split the sentences.</li></ul></li>
<li>"Carey dedicates a chapter in her 2020 memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey" same concern with tense
<ul><li>Changed to "dedicated"</li></ul></li>
<li>"well-received" I'm not sure but I think the hyphen is not necessary ("well received")
<ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></li>
<li>"number one song" should be "number-one song"
<ul><li>Changed.</li></ul></li>
<li>"Carey considers the video's production" same concern with tense

<p>James Longstreet was one of the leading Confederate generals during the American Civil War. Like many Civil War generals, Longstreet graduated from West Point Military Academy, fought in the Mexican-American War, and served on frontier duty. As a Confederate, he rose to become Robert E. Lee's chief subordinate in the Army of Northern Virginia. Longstreet was present at most major Confederate victories during the Civil War, and he nearly always played a decisive role. Longstreet had a tactical preference for the defensive, which at times contrasted with Lee's aggressive style. Longstreet strenuously disagreed with Lee's strategy at multiple times throughout the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863. After the war ended, Longstreet supported Reconstruction, unlike most former Confederates. For this he was lambasted as a traitor, and his detractors scrutinized his war record and accused him disloyalty by sabotaging Confederate victory in the war, at Gettysburg and at other instances. Since the late 20th century, Longstreet's reputation has improved among professional historians and the general public. He is now considered one of the war's greatest military commanders. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 22:47, 16 August 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>"A second attack soon began, but Confederate successes were hampered when inexperienced soldiers from Colonel Jubal Early's brigade sent to reinforce Longstreet began firing on their own men. Tyler eventually withdrew, as he had orders not to bring on a general engagement." - recommend getting a secondary source for this, especially the Early part, given that Longstreet had pretty rocky relations with a lot of the Confederate officers by the time this was written.  I personally don't have a First Bull Run book to consult, but I know of a few editors who might.  If you can't find a secondary source, I can probably go try to check out David Dezter's <i>Donnybrook: The Battle of Bull Run, 1861</i> from a local library and look in there</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Another good point. I checked Wert. He mentions that one of Early's regiments fired a volley which nearly hit Longstreet, but it doesn't say anything else.

<ul><li>I strongly recommend against using the rank of "General" as a shorthand, since General is how the CSA rank of full general is generally presented in sources.  For instance, "Longstreet received an order from General Joseph E. Johnston" - while Joe Johnston was promoted to full general the next month and his promotion date was backdated, he was technically only a Brigadier General at the time of First Bull Run.  I know this is picky, but it's kinda a minor accuracy thing</li></ul>

<ul><li>"Finding the ground he occupied untenable, Longstreet requested reinforcements from D.H. Hill's division a little further up the road and received Early's brigade, to which was later added the entire division" - what does the source (Longstreet's memoirs) say about when this request occurred?  <a href="/wiki/Stephen_W._Sears" title="Stephen W. Sears">Stephen W. Sears</a>'s <i>To the Gates of Richmond</i> states that Longstreet's request occurred "Earlier in the day [in context, earlier than when Union reinforcements arrived on the field], as the fighting intensified" as when Longstreet requested reinforcements.  Sears also attributes the request to wanting a reserve.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Longstreet (p. 74) says this: "From the swelling noise of battle I concluded that it would be well to ride to the front, and ordered the remaining brigade (Colston's) and the batteries of Dearing and Stribling to follow. Stuart sent his horse artillery under Pelham into action on the open field. [paragraph break] Viewing the ground on the left, I thought it not so well protected as [R.H.] Anderson conceived, and sent to D.H. Hill, who was a little advanced on the march, for one of his brigades." Wert p. 105 speaks of Confederates throwing the Union back; Wert p. 106 mentions the request for reinforcements. I believe that the article is correct here. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 03:28, 18 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>" Longstreet reported 9,000 Confederate troops engaged compared to 12,000 Union troops, and the Confederates suffered fewer casualties" - this is sourced to Longstreet.  I only have one secondary source about the Peninsula (<a href="/wiki/Richard_%22Dick%22_Wheeler" title="Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Wheeler">Richard "Dick" Wheeler</a>'s <i>Sword over Richmond</i> is primarily a collection of primary accounts), but Sears has very different numbers.  Sears has <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">Some 13,750 Confederates in the divisions of Longstreet and D. H. Hill saw action at Williamsburg</span>, not including the reserve troops.  He also states <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">During most of the day-long battle against Joe Hooker [...] [the Confederates] enjoyed a better than 1,300-man advantage over Hooker's unsupported division.  Only late in the afternoon, after the arrival of [...] [Union reinforcements], did the Federals finally gain a manpower advantage there</span></li></ul>

<ul><li>"On May 31, during the Battle of Seven Pines, Longstreet received his orders verbally from Johnston, but ended up apparently misremembering them." - what does Wert say about this? Sears p. 121 says <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">yet it is hard to believe that his [Joe Johnston's] instructions of the day before were so vague that Longstreet confused something so simple as which road he was to use.  More probably, Longstreet believed his command of the army's right wing allowed him the independence to change the plan, and that by shifting his division over to the Williamsburg Road he would not have to come under Johnston's eye - and Johnston's direct supervision - once the fighting began</span>  But Sears can be a bit of a maverick occassionally, so it would be good to see what other sources say about this.  I'm gonna leave a message for <a href="/wiki/User:BusterD" title="User:BusterD">User:BusterD</a> to see if they have anything that could be useful.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Wert disagrees. He says: "Longstreet evidently misunderstood his orders." (Wert p. 115) He offers alternate explanations before concluding that Longstreet having misremembered the road that he was supposed to march down is the most plausible scenario. "From the evidence and from his actions early that morning, Longstreet made an honest mistake in moving his division to the Williamsburg Road." (Wert p. 123) According to Alexander in <i>Fighting for the Confederacy,</i> "Gen. Longstreet entirely misconceived his orders and instead of marching straight down Nine Mile Road massing in front of G.W. Smith, he crosses over to the Williamsburg Road to get behind D.H. Hill. Of course he would not have done it had he not conceived himself ordered to do it." (Alexander 1989 p. 85) Wert explicitly concurs with Alexander's view that Longstreet would have only taken the road that he had if he felt that Johnston had ordered it. Piston calls Seven Pines a "colossal blunder" (p.31), says that "Longstreet erred badly" (p. 180), and, as the article says, calls it "the lowest point in Longstreet's military career" (p. 19). The consensus appears to be against Sears here. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 18:50, 18 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>I think that's most of my comments.  This article is an excellent effort about a significant figure.  The article would be one of the longer FAs, but I didn't think it seemed particularly bloated anywhere.  I will note that I'm a major nerd when it comes to this conflict, so what I consider to be due detail may be the result of me having great interest in minute material here. <a href="/wiki/User:Hog_Farm" title="User:Hog Farm">Hog Farm</a> <sub> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hog_Farm" title="User talk:Hog Farm">Talk</a></sub> 00:59, 19 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a>, thank you for your comment. I can't say I didn't see it coming. My featured article nominations tend to be a bit long. This is long too, but it isn't my longest nomination. I've had two longer. Andrew Jackson passed at almost 16,00 words, and John Adams passed at a little over 16,000, almost 1,000 words longer than this article. I know that this does not mean that this article should automatically be given a pass, but articles on very important topics are allowed to run a little long. The American Civil War is easily the largest war in the history of the United States, and an article on one of the top military commanders in the war, a man who was definitely in my opinion one of the two or three best Confederate generals, and also perhaps the war's most controversial general, seems important enough to me to allow for some extra space to cover his contributions and the debate surrounding them. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 01:18, 17 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>We non-Americans don't know what antebellum means so please link somewhere. And if "postbellum life" means "postwar life" more non-Americans would understand.
</p>
<dl><dd>I do not agree that this should be changed. Postbellum is Latin. It means "after the war." A quick Google search would reveal what the term "postbellum" means in America, and I don't see anything necessarily wrong with occasionally sending readers to the dictionary or to Google. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 20:32, 20 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a>I think we should make it as easy as possible for the readers - for example "The Economist" would not make the reader look up such a word just as it would not make Americans look up UK specific words.

<p>If known please mention why he was ambassador for such a short time.
</p>
<dl><dd>I had not mentioned it before because the chief Longstreet biography that I was using to write the article, the one by Jeffry Wert, glosses over his ambassadorship in two paragraphs and says nothing of his reasons for departure. The article's hefty length was also a concern and I was wary of extending it any further. However, it is a worthy subject. William Piston's biography of Longstreet is roughly half the size of Wert's, but he dedicates two solid pages to Longstreet's tenure as minister and I was able to glean a fairly solid summary from there. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 20:32, 20 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p><a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> - Is writing "P.M." in capitals normal in US English?

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a>, I understand what you meant now about the authors' death dates. I have removed the tags from the images where the author was unknown. I added books to the maps as sources for the data. I added the Brady-Handy copyright tag. Regarding the statue, I don't know anything other than that it was a privately-funded monument erected on public property. I don't know where that leaves us in terms of copyright. Thank you for your assistance. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 16:54, 19 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a>:</span> - I believe it depends on that (non-public) VRT tag.  If the tag applies to the photograph, the image is likely nonfree because the United States does not have <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama" title="Freedom of panorama">freedom of panorama</a> for 3D art, and I'm not seeing any indication that the statue is in the public domain. If the tag is from the copyright holder of the statue, then the image is fine.  But if the tag is for only the photograph, then it will need to be removed as the image would only really meet <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NFCC" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> in an article about the statue itself. <a href="/wiki/User:Hog_Farm" title="User:Hog Farm">Hog Farm</a> <sub> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hog_Farm" title="User talk:Hog Farm">Talk</a></sub> 17:07, 19 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a>, the author of the photo is a Wikipedia editor, and since VRT interacts with the public, I think that it is likely for the statue rather than the photo. <a href="/wiki/User:Display_name_99" title="User:Display name 99">Display name 99</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Display_name_99" title="User talk:Display name 99">talk</a>) 21:34, 19 August 2021 (UTC)

Were these events before the Championship? If so, I think this needs to go before the preceding sentence, and more context for why this is important should be included. Maybe something like, "Alex Higgins, who won the competition in 1972 and 1982, was banned from the first two ranking events of the season. This was a punishment imposed by the WPBSA for behaviour including headbutting the tournament director at the 1986 UK Championship.

<p>This article is about a historic building in Manhattan, New York City, erected in the 1890s and 1900s. The courthouse building, originally the Hall of Records, contains dozens of detailed facade sculptures and a vault-like lobby. Like the neighboring <a href="/wiki/Tweed_Courthouse" title="Tweed Courthouse">Tweed Courthouse</a> (an FA), the Surrogate's Courthouse was mired in controversy through its construction, especially after the original architect died. The term "horganizing and slatterifying" was used to criticize the new architects. Unlike its neighbor, the Surrogate's Courthouse didn't receive the same level of opposition upon its completion, and it's mostly been used as a surrogate's court for New York state, as well as a hall of records. It is a National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark, and it continues to be used as a courthouse.
</p><p>This page was promoted as a Good Article a year ago and was recently copyedited through the GOCE, for which I am very grateful. I think it's up to FA quality now, and I look forward to all comments and feedback.  <a href="/wiki/User:Epicgenius" title="User:Epicgenius">Epicgenius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Epicgenius" title="User talk:Epicgenius">talk</a>) 15:08, 15 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>Suggest removing some detail from:
"The building was renamed the Surrogate's Courthouse in 1962 and, over the years, has undergone few alterations.

</p><p>"Renamed the Surrogate's Courthouse in 1962, the building has been little altered over the years and is a <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" title="National Historic Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>."
</p><p>But we non-Americans don't know what a Surrogate's Court is so I think adding just a few words on that to the lead would be interesting.

<li>"The exterior contains fifty-four sculptures by prize-winning artists". An exterior containing sculptures does not sound right to me.

<p><i>Zmaj</i> (Dragon) was built as a seaplane tender, but was barely used in that role, being converted to a minelayer before WWII. Captured during the invasion of Yugoslavia, the Germans put her to use as <i>Drache</i> (also Dragon) and then <i>Schiff 50</i>, mainly as a troop transport, escort and minelayer. Interestingly, she was use for shipborne trials of helicopters in 1942–1943. One of the minefields she laid in the Aegean accounted for one Allied submarine and two destroyers, with another severely damaged, all in a matter of a week or so. She was sunk by British aircraft in late 1944. Sturm brought her up to GA ten years ago, and has worked on her sporadically since, we've recently added quite a bit from a couple of new books, and she passed Milhist ACR last month. We reckon she's now ready for FAC. <a href="/wiki/User:Peacemaker67" title="User:Peacemaker67">Peacemaker67</a>  (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Peacemaker67" title="User talk:Peacemaker67">click to talk to me</a>) 05:02, 14 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>This is a splendid article, but I have a few quibbles.
</p>
<ul><li>General</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>First – and others may disagree with me – I find the use of the preterite for reporting what analysts have written extremely jarring. I mean such constructions as "Denis Matthews described the first movement … Charles Rosen called it…"  I can't recall seeing this form in any reputable source, where "So-and-so writes…" or "So-and-so has written…" is the customary usage.

<ul><li>There are letters I believe that Beethoven sent to Schlesinger indicating his intent to dedicate the sonata to Antonie Brentano, but for reasons unknown to the sources I've consulted, the publishers never actually carried out Beethoven's wishes.

<ul><li>No!—Thankfully. would be interesting but is probably beyond the expected scope of Wikipedia. <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 20:43, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Well, here's what I think the article is mainly lacking at the moment (nothing major). Beethoven's late sonatas are notoriously hard to understand, complicated, boundary-pushing, harmonically intricate etc. This work seems, comparably, rather routine (though lovely regardless) and perhaps not nearly as adventurous as the others. The exception to this may be the fugue, but based on the descriptions you've included from commentators (and my own experience), the first two movements seem rather conservative. Can something like this be included in the lead somewhere?—in doing so, you could include its being part of Beethoven's late sonatas, a point which I also thought was missing. If any sources go into such difference in detail, such comment might be added to the reception section. I notice that only one other of B's late sonatas is the standard three movements.
<ul><li>I do *feel* that your analysis gives valuable insight into the sonata, but any of your or my thoughts on the analyses (e.g. something that is not explicitly evident in the sources) might constitute <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SYN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SYN">WP:SYN</a> (I am open to disagreement here though). As of yet, I have not found a particular passage from the sources stating/supporting the idea that the sonata is more conservative/less difficult than the other late sonatas. Rather, I recall a passage from Martin Cooper describing how the sonata's emotional depth and difficulty makes it a common test piece and should not be approached by young amateurs (I don't however consider this claim by Cooper to be very encyclopedic and didn't include it in the article since this isn't supposed to be a manual for how/who should play the piece). <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 14:55, 3 September 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>No worries then, I had a feeling this would be the case. <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 20:43, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Ah recordings. What an impossible section to write given the sources available! Hmmm, at the least I would include the cycles of <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Serkin" title="Rudolf Serkin">Rudolf Serkin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Igor_Levit" title="Igor Levit">Igor Levit</a> (the latter is basically a reference recording now). I know that Myra Hess's recording of the sonata is rather famous (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000012935?rskey=LJx30J&amp;result=2">grove</a>); I've never heard of her, but <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Long" title="Kathleen Long">Kathleen Long</a> seems to be well regarded for her recording of Op. 110 as well (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000016947?rskey=eeFfM2&amp;result=7">[32]</a>).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Tim Riley was concerned in his review over what standard the recordings were chosen for mention. So far, the best we could seem to muster were the top results on Presto Music that came with recording dates and/or recording awards. Accordingly, I added in the Levit recording, since that was one of the top results for Beethoven Complete Piano Sonata recordings on the platform. Thus, I was wondering what in particular distinguished the Serkin, Hess, and Long recordings? Besides on Grove, I was not able to find a lot of coverage of Hess's or Long's recordings. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 01:26, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Well, presumably those cycles could be included in the recording sections for every Beethoven sonata, as their importance is dependent on the cycles as a whole, not Op. 110? Clearly there is not much written about recordings of this individual sonata, but given that there are no recordings currently included where that of Op. 110 in particular is notable, it might make sense to include Hess and Long (since it seems they are known for this sonata, not their own cycles). Not a huge sticking point, however. <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 20:43, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a>:</span> That makes sense--I have included Hess's recording for now. I am still wavering on the Serkin cycle though since we've already mentioned a lot of important cycle recordings, and Serkin is included anyways in the late piano sonatas discography (both Rudolf and Peter!). As for Long, the Grove entry only says she "performed" the Op. 110, not necessarily recorded it. This might explain why trying to find other literature on Long's recording was so difficult. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 23:41, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>It looks like—besides this piece—the term "Arioso" was almost never used in instrumental music (per <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000001240?rskey=oL64lu&amp;result=11">Grove</a>) so perhaps such a detail is worth including?</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Last I heard, Enceladus had an HE shape for a different rotational period, indicating that it's frozen out of HE. But there've been a lot of measurements of Enceladus since then, so that conclusion might be dated. A lot of refs use circular reasoning with these kinds of statements, though, so we need to be a bit careful.

<p>Good to see this article finally brought back up to snuff. It is so much better now! A few minor issues, though. 
</p>
<ul><li>The last para in the name section is composed of three unrelated topics (the adjective, the symbol, and the element Cerium). They do not belong in the same paragraph. The FA criteria do not forbid single-sentence paragraphs; they say <i>the number of single-sentence paragraphs should be minimized, since they can inhibit the flow of the text.</i> Like avoiding passives, that's a general rule of thumb, and shouldn't be adhered to too strictly: Cobbling unrelated topics together also inhibits the flow of the text. Better several concise paragraphs that read well than a long meandering one that doesn't. In this case, there's not a lot to say on these topics.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I agree. WP:PARAGRAPH says, <i>One-sentence paragraphs are unusually emphatic, and should be used sparingly,</i> and MOS:PARA says, <i>Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.</i> This is standard practice for writing, not just a WP thing. But "sparingly" doesn't mean zero. When the topics are unrelated, the alternative is to expand on them. One of the topics (adjectival forms) was reduced to a single sentence under GAR; the other, on the element, could easily be expanded, but would be off-topic in this article. I suppose we could move trivia from the footnotes into the main text, but really, trivia doesn't belong in an FA except possibly in a footnote. (The trivia here being that the discoverer of Palladium recalled that he once thought to name it after Ceres, but didn't.) When you have to bend over backwards to accommodate a general guideline, damaging the article in the process, it's better to make an exception. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 20:04, 17 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>In this particular case, I would go for one paragraph only (as it is in the article right now). It is my feeling that most editors here at FAC would do the same, and featured articles with single-sentence paragraphs are hard to find. I don't think the reader will be confused that these things are discussed within the same paragraph, at least I was not; it read quite fluently and naturally. --<a href="/wiki/User:Jens_Lallensack" title="User:Jens Lallensack">Jens Lallensack</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jens_Lallensack" title="User talk:Jens Lallensack">talk</a>) 20:18, 17 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, the reader <i>can</i> follow it. But that's not what a paragraph is for. A paragraph is supposed to contain a coherent topic. We don't just put in a paragraph break after every ten sentences regardless of topic.

<dd>At <a href="/wiki/Paragraph" title="Paragraph">paragraph</a>, we say, <i>A paragraph ... is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.</i> According to that definition, what we have here is not a paragraph.

<dl><dd>I don't see it that way. To me, the content seems related enough to be discussed in a single paragraph (talking about the second paragraph in the "Name and symbol" section).

<dl><dd>In a well-crafted paragraph, the first line introduces the topic of that paragraph. Here the first line has nothing to do with the rest of the paragraph. Yes, all three topics relate to the name, and thus are all belong in the 'name' section. But they don't form a coherent sub-topic within that section. If we're going to merge them together, it would make just as much sense to merge them all into the preceding paragraph, which is also about the name. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 21:06, 17 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Under 'discovery', in the midst of Kepler's, Titius' and Bode's ideas about a missing planet between Mars and Jupiter, there's a comment by Kant about how there <i>shouldn't</i> be a planet there.

<p>What are the implications? The resonance article gives their mismatch at 0.7°/cycle, for a randomization time of a millennium, so I would think there could be no long-term consequence to this.

<p>I have been looking for the final identity of the Piazzi feature for months. Besides being impossible to Google (every article on Ceres is going to mention the word "Piazzi", since he discovered the damn thing), there seems to have been a concerted effort on the part of the Dawn mission team not to mention it. I've assumed the most likely answer, which is that Piazzi is Occator crater, but I haven't been able to confirm it. At this point, I may have to start emailing people. Of course, that wouldn't help if they can't point me to a source. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Serendipodous" title="User:Serendipodous"><span style="color: #00b;">Serendi</span></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Serendipodous" title="Special:Contributions/Serendipodous"><sup><span style="color: #b00;">pod</span></sup></a><span style="color: #00b;"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Serendipodous" title="User talk:Serendipodous">ous</a></span></b> 09:55, 17 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It's not uncommon for large features in low-res images to disappear in high-res. Looks like Piazzi isn't a geological feature, but a local deviation in albedo.

<li>Good catch. Revised.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>"Despite being closer to Earth than Jupiter, which has been known since antiquity, Ceres's small size means that its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, peaking at opposition once during its 15- to 16-month synodic period. Thus even at its brightest, it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies." - I feel like this could be written in three or four sentences. Otherwise, the "Despite" construct isn't paid off until the second sentence, which could be too complicated for some readers. Maybe just switch the order around? For example - "Even when at its brightest, Ceres is usually too dim to be seen from Earth by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies. Despite being closer to Earth than Jupiter, which has been known since antiquity, Ceres's small size means that its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, peaking at opposition once during its 15- to 16-month synodic period." Even then, I'm not sure that you need to add that Jupiter has been known since antiquity, since the focus is on Ceres.</li></ul>
<p><b>revised</b>. 
</p>
<ul><li>"Its surface features are barely visible even with the most powerful telescopes, and little was known of them until the robotic NASA spacecraft Dawn entered orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015." - since the lead is fairly short, maybe add some of the information learned from the Dawn mission, considering how important that mission was for the understanding of Ceres.</li>
<li>"Ceres appears to be partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less-dense but stronger crust that is at most 30% ice. " - the word "appears" sticks out to me and reads of some uncertainty. Maybe something like - "Based on observations, scientists believe that Ceres is partially differentiated..." or something.
<ul><li>Since that info was found by Dawn, makes sense to credit Dawn there.</li></ul></li>
<li>" It probably no longer has an internal ocean of liquid water, but there is brine that can flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface." - similar as the above, the "probably" doesn't sit right with me. Could you explain why the "probably"? Also, this would be a good place to add a bit about possible (however unlikely) habitability, since the lead is on the short side.

<li>"As the first such body to be discovered, in 1851 Ceres was given the designation 1 Ceres under the modern system of minor-planet designations." - who decided this? This is a pretty big moment, considering that it's the first, so a bit of history would be good.
<ul><li>Again, there was no precise moment when it happened. The first to do so was Benjamin Valtz in 1852, but he didn't use it for Ceres.</li></ul></li>
<li>"By the 1860s, the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as Ceres and the major planets was widely accepted, though a precise definition of "planet" was not formulated until 2006,[35] when the debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a planet led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet." - can you find a way to re-word so you don't say the word "planet" four times in a sentence?
<ul><li>revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>"But on 24 August 2006 the assembly adopted the additional requirement that a planet must have "cleared the neighborhood around its orbit". " - poor grammar, starting a sentence with "But"

<li>"Compared to other planets and dwarf planets, Ceres's orbit is moderately though not drastically inclined (i = 10.6° compared to 7° for Mercury and 17° for Pluto) and eccentric (e = 0.08 compared to 0.09 for Mars)." - could you explain this in laymen terms?
<ul><li>revised.</li></ul></li>
<li>"Orbital resonances, instances in which celestial objects fall into gravitational step with the orbits of other, larger objects, are rare in the asteroid belt, due to the asteroids' small masses and large separations." - this sentence is a bit complicated. I suggest something like "Due to their small masses and large separations, it is rare for asteroids to have orbital resonances, in which celestial objects fall into gravitational step with the orbits of other, larger objects." Not sure if that wording is accurate, but something along those lines is clearer.

<dl><dd>There is nothing official here apart from the IAU definition. A body cannot be "officially" a DP, any more than a stallar object can be "officially" a brown dwarf, because the IAU definition is not "whatever we decide is a DP", but the physical criteria that define the category of DP -- and the IAU has no control of the physical properties of an object. All we can do is follow RS's as to whether it fits the definition. There have been some RS doubts as to whether Ceres fits the definition. I have no idea whether those doubts will stand up to scrutiny. If we find RS's that say those doubts are either spurious or have been addressed, then I'll be fine with saying that Ceres is a DP.</dd>
<dd>Or, if we find a RS that astronomers have come to ignore the IAU definition and instead follow Stern's rule of thumb, "if it looks like a world, then it's a (dwarf) planet", then after modifying the DP article accordingly I'd be happy with saying Ceres is a DP. It's certainly a "world" in Sterns' sense. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 20:39, 2 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Kwami, Wikipedia is not helping anyone by saying that Ceres isn't a dwarf planet. Everyone who is remotely qualified in the required fields says Ceres is  dwarf planet. You can disagree, but ultimately you're just crying <a href="/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" title="No true Scotsman">No true dwarf planet</a>.

<dl><dd>No. We follow RS's on WP. We don't dumb things down because we don't think the reader can handle it. "Everyone who is remotely qualified ... says Ceres is  dwarf planet" -- except for those who don't. It would be easier for all of us if Ceres were a DP. But we have a RS saying that's not clear. Until you address the RS issue, you cannot cherry-pick the sources you like and ignore those you don't.</dd>
<dd>Again, if you can provide a consensus from "everyone who is remotely qualified" that those RS concerns are not relevant / have been resolved, then I'm happy to accept Ceres as a DP. But it's up to you to provide the RS's for your claims.

<p>Serendipodous has gotten really PO'd over my stance on this issue, fearing it puts FA status in jeopardy, so perhaps this deserves its own section where others can comment. 
</p><p>I don't know whether Ceres is a DP or not. It's certainly referred to as one often enough, including by the IAU (and this years before anyone could actually know). But Serendipodous believes that an object is a DP or not based on whether the IAU announces it to be, not based on whether it actually fits the IAU definition of a DP. That's not how any science works -- defining a category so we have an agreed set of terms does not determine the physical characteristics of any particular body. That's up researchers to determine. 
</p><p>I'm aware of only one RS that addresses the issue of whether Ceres fits the IAU definition of DP. It concludes that there are anomalies that have not been explained. Those issues may now be resolved. There are presumably many other sources that I've never heard of. It may be that other astronomers have rejected those doubts, and that the consensus is that Ceres is a DP. I don't know, and I hardly care, except as a bit of trivia. But I do care that we follow RS's in a FA. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 02:20, 3 September 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The views I express below grew out of the discusion at <a href="/wiki/Talk:List_of_possible_dwarf_planets#Mercury" title="Talk:List of possible dwarf planets">Talk:List of possible dwarf planets#Mercury</a>.</dd>
<dd>The most interesting point is that it has been known <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984EM%26P...31..135B">since 1984</a> that Mercury is not in HE in the strict sense(!), and yet the IAU didn't see any problem with that when writing its 2006 definition that required HE for planets (and dwarf planets too). This kind of suggests to me that either the term HE is not being understood in a strict sense in the IAU definition, or the definition is just being ignored in favour of the bald list. Now that MESSENGER happened, it's beyond doubt that Mercury is not in HE; the fact that nobody made any noises about it suggests that at least one of my conjectures is correct. (Okay, you could argue that they wouldn't want to demote their planet of study, but even then it could have been spun as "the IAU definition needs work", which didn't happen either.) Even more strongly: you'd think that doubts about Ceres being in HE would be music to the ears of Plutophiles, because one of the strongest counters to Pluto alone as a planet is "what about Ceres" – but no one made a fuss. And even more interestingly, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.550..219O/abstract">Ortiz</a> had no problem calling Haumea a DP while suggesting that it could not be in HE.</dd>
<dd>So, the definition of planets and dwarf planets says HE, but no one connects it to those cases. This makes me think that asking for strict HE may, at the very least, be falling into a trap of not getting some unstated context. I remind that the IAU definition of a planet does not define "clearing the neighbourhood" either, and if we were to overlook some context on that, we'd be back to saying Jupiter is not a planet because of trojan asteroids. This could very well be a similar case.</dd>
<dd>It seems to me safer to use the actual statements. Well, according to their site, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/">Ceres is a dwarf planet</a>. And while I've indeed seen doubts about Ceres being in strict-sense HE, it certainly <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22ceres%22+%22dwarf+planet%22&amp;btnG=">seems to me</a> that Ceres' status as a DP is not actually questioned by astronomers or planetary scientists. That's actually an even clearer situation than, say, Quaoar (which the IAU does not recognise as a DP, but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&amp;q=%22quaoar%22+%22dwarf+planet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5">quite a few serious scientists do</a>, and anyway the IAU admits that there may be more dwarf planets than the five they recognised).</dd>
<dd>Therefore, I think it's best to call Ceres an unqualified DP, reflecting both the IAU (which names it as one on their pages) and common usage. The fact that it's not in strict HE seems somehow unrelated in actual usage, despite the way the definition is phrased. Calling Ceres only a possible DP, while perhaps reflecting the strict letter of the IAU definition, seems not to follow any actual source. It seems to be the result of original-to-WP interpretation of the IAU definition, and I worry that it overlooks some context that was meant to be understood, just like a reading of the IAU definition that excludes Jupiter for its trojans would. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 03:21, 3 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>"Quaoar (which the IAU does not recognise as a DP)" -- the IAU is not in the business of recognizing DPs, so the fact that they don't recognize a body as a DP means nothing at all. Haumea and Makemake were special cases, part of a bureaucratic compromise as to which committees got to review proposed names for which bodies. That decision has nothing to do with the status of any other body, and the IAU even made a provision for Haumea and Makemake turning out not to be DPs.</dd>
<dd>That quibble aside, I don't have a problem with any of your suggestions in principle. Grundy, Noll &amp; Buie et al. state that Orcus is a DP, even though their research only shows it to be a solid body. If we stuck to fairly recent RS's (Tancredi and Brown are both rather dated), we could say that Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong (per NASA), Ceres, Quaoar and Orcus "are" DP's, as far as we know, and that Salacia and Sedna remain possibilities. The WP articles for those bodies could start with something like "Orcus is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt in resonance with Neptune," with a RS stating that it's a dwarf planet, or that "Salacia is a large trans-Neptunian object and possible dwarf planet." Brown's judgements should probably be removed from leads as being a decade out of date. We also might want to sometimes fudge things a bit by using the word "planetoid". In the body of the article, we could get into why people believe Orcus or whatever to be a DP, but that's no different than saying Hittite is an Indo-European language in the lead and info box and then getting into why people believe that to be true, as well as reporting on minority theories that it's not (e.g. Indo-Hittite). The same of course would be true of Ceres: "Ceres is the largest asteroid and sole dwarf planet in the asteroid belt", with unexplained anomalies in its shape left to the body of the article. Or "Mercury is the smallest planet and the closest to the Sun", with its deviations from HE covered in the text.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think that would be a much more practical approach to our articles. The problem we'd run into is that our DP article is a FA, and it strictly follows the IAU definition. It could be that it should be rewritten to follow a more practical definition (a DP is what RS's say is a DP, presenting the IAU as just one of several RS's) or have its FA status reviewed. But we don't want two FA's contradicting each other, with one saying "dwarf planet" is a term of convenience for world-like bodies, and the other saying it's a technical term with a precise definition. As you point out, the reality is that no-one pays much attention to the IAU definition. But for the FA 'dwarf planet' to reflect that reality, we'd need RS's that that is the case. Or, if there's consensus that we devote too much space to finicky definitions, we could gut the DP article, leaving all but a summary of the definition to "IAU definition of a planet", revoke its FA status and merge it with an abbreviated 'list of possible DPs'.</dd>
<dd>If there are no objections to me removing claims in the DP article than a DP is a category strictly defined by the IAU, so there would be no contradiction if Ceres were promoted to FA, then I have no objection to Serendipodous wording this article the way he wants to. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 04:45, 4 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Maybe the DP article should just say that the IAU formalised HE, but scientists use it more loosely (and as an example, we can cite Ortiz saying Haumea is a DP but that it can't be in HE). Actually, it seems not far from that. Even the IAU sometimes talks more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/">loosely</a>: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">A dwarf planet is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large enough (massive enough) to have its own gravity pull itself into a round (or nearly round) shape.</q> (So, it just needs to be round, and have enough gravity for that to be the cause. No "coincidentally round" objects like Phobos, of course.)</dd>
<dd>Judging from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22quaoar%22+%22dwarf+planet%22&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=%22quaoar">Google Scholar results</a>, some sources simply call Quaoar a DP, and those that demur still say it's likely. So, maybe "highly likely DP" is the best way to go here. Haumea seems universally called a DP, maybe because the IAU naming it as a presumed one. So I don't think it'd be too different: the IAU five can get called unqualified DPs, and for example Quaoar can be called a highly likely DP. Which is more or less the distinction the tables at <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_planet" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planet</a> already make: the almost-certain candidates are included, but the IAU five are highlighted. More iffy ones like Salacia can then get the "probable" qualifier.</dd>
<dd>Does Grundy think that not being solid necessarily excludes DP-hood? If you take the HE idea it should, but if you take the idea of shape, then maybe not, right? Couldn't, say, Chaos and Varda still be round even if they aren't solid? <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:16, 4 September 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Methone is round under its own gravity. So is any large rubble pile. So yeah, I suspect being solid (in the sense of no interstitial spaces) is sine qua non. As for Grundy et al., yeah, they refer to solid bodies as DPs, but not dark, low-density bodies like G!kun||'homdima.</dd>
<dd>The site you linked to is 'Astronomy for the Public'. It's dumbed down for public consumption. It would be different if they said "like Vesta or Pallas", or gave some other specific example. For a RS of the IAU's position, we need a formal statement, publication in <i>Icarus</i> or the like.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the IAU didn't invent the term. Alan Stern did. So it's really not NPOV to use their definition, which can be explained in detail at 'IAU definition of planet'. I'll start editing the DP article to be more neutral, though it may take a while. Unless you want to -- you might be a better choice, since I've gotten into so many quarrels about this.</dd>
<dd>I do object to making the IAU the gate-keeper. That's not their role. They didn't claim it and don't want it. If we're not going to follow a strict definition, then we need to follow RS's, which isn't the IAU but the researchers who actually work on these objects. All objects down to Orcus are called DPs by the people who investigate them. I have my doubts, personally, but TRUTH.  — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 22:29, 4 September 2021 (UTC)

<dd>I would think everyone would doubt Sedna, unless you're like Stern and accept Proteus. Its estimated size puts it in Grundy et al's transition range, and I wonder how realistic the 10% error bar is on its size. Though if its albedo really is 32%, that suggests resurfacing or at least recent outgassing, which is promising. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 04:53, 5 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Anyway, since Ceres is now called a DP here as a result of this discussion, I guess that resolves the problem as far as this article goes. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 04:40, 5 September 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>Hi <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> and thanks for bringing this up.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I'll be happy if I can make the DP article consistent with this one. I've had edit wars there before, with people insisting that a DP is what the IAU defines it to be, not how astronomers actually use the term. As long as the DP article can say, basically,<i> 'A' is how Stern (who coined the term) uses it; 'B' is how the IAU defines it, which essentially everyone ignores; and 'C D E' are how other astronomers have used it</i>, so that what is or is not a DP is a matter of usage rather than exact definition, then this article is good. But if at DP there is consensus that <i>this article is a FA, it must adhere to the letter of the law</i>, then to be consistent we won't be able to say here than Ceres is a DP, unless someone finds better sources than we currently have. But I don't think there's any reason to hold up FA review for that -- it's a terminological quibble that doesn't have much real effect on this article. This article shouldn't be held hostage to that one. If there are irreconcilable differences between the two, then we'll have to start a broader discussion. But yesterday I made edits that a few years ago would've sparked a furious edit-war, and so far not a peep. So maybe it won't be a problem this time around. — <a href="/wiki/User:Kwamikagami" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kwamikagami" title="User talk:Kwamikagami">talk</a>) 06:13, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>My article at <a href="/wiki/2017_Africa_Cup_of_Nations_Final" title="2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final">2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final</a> recently became featured, so I'm now moving on to the 2015 edition of the same competition.

The 2015 final featured Ghana and the Ivory Coast, 4-time- and 1-time-winners respectively. The game was unfortunately not the most exciting ever, finishing 0–0 with few chances for either side. The championship was therefore settled by a <a href="/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)" title="Penalty shoot-out (association football)">penalty shoot-out</a>, which Ivory Coast won 9–8 after Ghana's goalkeeper missed a kick against his opposite number, and he Ivorian goalkeeper then scored.

<p>Nice to see you building up a collection of FAs for African football. With the caveats that I am neither an expert in African football nor a native speaker of English, here are my comments:
</p>
<ul><li>Check the article for <a href="/wiki/MOS:NUM" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:NUM">MOS:NUM</a> issues. In <a href="/wiki/2017_Africa_Cup_of_Nations_Final" title="2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final">2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final</a> we have "The tournament consisted of sixteen teams who had qualified for the event, divided into four round-robin groups consisting of four teams" but here we have "The tournament consisted of 16 teams, who were divided into 4 groups of 4, each team playing the other 3 group members once in a round-robin format."
<dl><dd>I think the same problem was in 2017 re that paragraph, so I've amended to match that. Also a couple of 10 -&gt; ten re penalties and players. Other than that, I can't see any obvious inconsistencies. Times of the match are all digits, while most other bits and bobs are lower numbers written as words. &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 16:17, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul>

<li>Ghana were placed in Group C --&gt; this suggests a deliberate act. Was it? Usually it is a random draw
<dl><dd>I don't think so. I think I just meant that CAF placed them there, by whatever means.

<li>The match remained goal-less until injury time at the end in the second half, and Ghana appeared poised to exit the tournament. --&gt; this confused me: it makes me believe Algeria scored
<dl><dd>Right. It was based on the BBC article's phrasing "dramatic late winner to keep alive his side's hopes of reaching the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals", but in reality I don't think Ghana would have been completely eliminated even if they'd not won. So I've removed that aspect and just left the fact that they scored a last minute winner. &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 16:17, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

<p><b>Comment</b> My first impression on reading through is that as a description of events that evening the article does a good job. However, the article could do more in terms of putting the match in a wider context. Prior to this match Spain were perennial underachievers who hadn't won a tournament in 44 years. What were the expectations going into the match? My memory is that they were tournament favourites, were they? How many fans travelled from the respective countries? What was the mood in each country? The tournament was the first triumph of the "tiki-taka" style that would dominate at both international and club level for the next few years. The term "tiki-taka" doesn't appear once. <a href="/wiki/User:Oldelpaso" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oldelpaso" title="User talk:Oldelpaso">talk</a>) 15:17, 9 August 2021 (UTC)

In being a stickler (though I hope, not a nuisance) I would recommend such a source be switched out, unless it can be explained how its quality matches the FAC criteria.

<p>The article is well-written, neutral and comprehensive. I support it for FA. My comments in comparison with similar articles for Australia (and other commonwealth countries) are:
</p>
<ol><li>around the discussion on discrimination of non-white or Chinese people around 1900s.

<li>Apart from the legislation, in Australia, a very useful material that people can research on citizenship and migration laws is Procedures Advice Manual (PAM3) on LEGENDcom. A residency calculator, citizenship test/interview information are probably available from a government or a reputable website for free.  Please see if anything to this effect exists for the case of New Zealand and if it is worth mentioning in the article (or external links section). It is possible to mention that these requirements (test/interview) do not exist (or just trivial). This will help make the article more informative and practical. --<a href="/wiki/User:Taweetham" title="User:Taweetham">Taweetham</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Taweetham" title="User talk:Taweetham">talk</a>) 01:27, 7 August 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>I am not knowledgeable on this.  Please see if this should be included.  Citizenship test is a big deal elsewhere and if there is serious discussion about it in New Zealand then it may need to be in the article. "NZ First MP and Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin said she would prefer to give some consideration to a citizenship test, similar to Canada." <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/top/367595/nz-first-members-want-migrants-and-refugees-to-sign-to-core-values">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/top/367595/nz-first-members-want-migrants-and-refugees-to-sign-to-core-values</a> --<a href="/wiki/User:Taweetham" title="User:Taweetham">Taweetham</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Taweetham" title="User talk:Taweetham">talk</a>) 16:15, 8 August 2021 (UTC)

<li>To my understanding, all past <a href="/wiki/Referendums_in_New_Zealand" title="Referendums in New Zealand">Referendums in New Zealand</a> are not relevant to the citizenship law.  (Unlike the situation in Australia, <a href="/wiki/1967_Australian_referendum_(Aboriginals)" title="1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals)">1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals)</a> was very important to define citizenship of indigenous people.) Having said that, the nationality law is still probably an important aspect of <a href="/wiki/Independence_of_New_Zealand" title="Independence of New Zealand">Independence of New Zealand</a>.

<ul><li>Added a &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:See_also" title="Template:See also">see also</a>&#125;&#125; link to the independence article. It's included in the lead.

<li>Statistics/numerical aspect in the article:  If possible, I wish to see the implication of the nationality law on the population of New Zealand.  This can be either longitudinal or cross-sectional.  An example statement is "In 2016 nearly half (49%) of all Australians were either born overseas or had at least one parent who was born overseas."

<li>For Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau, please confirm if this is similar to <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Island#Immigration_and_citizenship" title="Norfolk Island">Norfolk_Island#Immigration_and_citizenship</a>.  The residency time can count toward naturalization but it is actually outside Australian migration zone. It is an important and interesting legal point. --<a href="/wiki/User:Taweetham" title="User:Taweetham">Taweetham</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Taweetham" title="User talk:Taweetham">talk</a>) 16:25, 8 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>I believe time in the Realm countries counts towards that requirement, but an applicant needs to hold permanent residence before they are able to apply for citizenship. Since the minimum requirement for PR in the Realm countries is 10 years, it doesn't really matter for the purposes of being granted citizenship; any person qualifying for permanent residence there would also have already met the five-year requirement for NZ citizenship. <a href="/wiki/User:Horserice" title="User:Horserice">Horserice</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Horserice" title="User talk:Horserice">talk</a>) 21:30, 8 August 2021 (UTC)

The term "<a href="/wiki/British_subject" title="British subject">British subject</a>" is a bit complicated I think so some rephrasing here could aid with understanding.
<ul><li>Answering this with the other question on British subjects below.
<ul><li>I'm still not sure about this, especially as it links to the <a href="/wiki/British_subject" title="British subject">British subject</a> article (which talks about the current meaning of the term and doesn't match up with the usage in the lead). Separately, the way it reads comes across as "New Zealand residents were classed as British subjects, which then became Commonwealth citizenship." I don't know how to describe exactly why, but that just reads wrong IMO.

<ul><li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Any person born in New Zealand (or anywhere within Crown dominions) was a natural-born British subject.

<dl><dd><ul><li>Rephrased to clarify status of UK-born subjects. For the second part of your question, presumably you mean foreign nationals who naturalised as British subjects in other parts of the Empire?

<ul><li>Rephrased this sentence to remove the reference to residence requirements. There was no specific timeframe according to the legislation, the governor just had to approve a person's application. Presumably, they would have been resident in NZ for some time since travel between anywhere off the islands during this time period was inconvenient to say the least.
<ul><li>That works too. Could be worth checking a secondary source to be sure. It's not uncommon for acts to be implemented differently in practice than in law (see sentencing guidelines vs statutory requirements, for example). So a law that says it's up to the governor to approve an application may well be backed with de facto requirements (set by the governor or someone to whom the power is delegated). <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 15:18, 8 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>Comment: The fact that nationality is not the same as citizenship should be spelled out. Yes, I get that the British Empire, and thus Commonwealth Nations, tend to use the terms synonymously, but nationality is belonging and governed by international law, whereas citizenship is rights and obligations governed by domestic law. In essence nationality describes the relationship of persons to the nation and citizenship describes their relationship and responsibilities within the nation.
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Where do you think it should go in this article? And are you saying that an explanation probably needs to be given in <i>every</i> nationality law article?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I typically put it in the lede and yes, IMO it should go in every nationality law article (and we should have an entire series of "Citizenship <i>in</i> Foo" articles), primarily because British influence is huge, lots of people misunderstand the term, and there is a definite legal distinction. Also because we must focus on readers. Conflating the two terms makes it difficult for readers to understand the historical position of many states to have citizen-nationals and non-citizen nationals. In other words, having nationality doesn't automatically entitle you to rights. (By the by I loved your talk page discussion on the confusion.) I am guessing you have sources, based on that discussion.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>What should we be citing here to introduce this distinction? I can't find any material that specifically mentions the difference between New Zealand nationals and citizens, because functionally there isn't one.<br />Side note: while searching for material on this distinction, I came across <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/files/Nationality%20and%20Statelessness.pdf">this</a> (p. 3, first paragraph of the foreward) from the UNHCR of all places that specifically mentions the current interchangability of the terms "citizenship" and "nationality" in international law. Maybe it's that the "historical position of states" having citizen nationals and non-citizen nationals is just that; a <i>historical</i> distinction not reflected in current meaning or usage.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Because this is an article on law, we need to look at the legal distinction.<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=Mr6Y45439A0C&amp;lpg=PA2">Boll pp. xv, 2</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=IXgpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Citizenship+is+a+conglomerate+of+special+political+and+other+rights%22&amp;redir_esc=y"></a><a href="/wiki/Allan_Rosas" title="Allan Rosas">Rosas</a> p 34 indicate nationality is used to refer to the relationship of an individual and a state in international law, whereas citizenship is used to define the relationship under domestic law. Laurie Fransman, who the Home Office has called an expert on British nationality law states, "Citizenship and  nationality, as distinct from one another, both involve relationships between the individual and the  state. In the case of citizenship, the relationship is more concerned with the individual within the state; in the case of nationality, it is more concerned with the individual and the state in their international context." (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/fransmans-british-nationality-law-9781845920951/">2011, p 4</a>) He goes on to say on page 4 that in Britain, and thus the Commonwealth countries, it is common to use citizenship as a synonym for nationality, "though in statutory law the terms are not interchangeable" and are dealt with by differing administrative bodies. Let me know if you want me to copy and email snippets from Fransman to you.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Yeah, if you could send over that bit of Fransman you're referring to, that would help. <a href="/wiki/User:Horserice" title="User:Horserice">Horserice</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Horserice" title="User talk:Horserice">talk</a>) 22:59, 25 August 2021 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess this is a related question, but doesn't have anything to do with this article. If there should be a "Citizenship in ___" article for every country that talks about domestic civil and political rights, where would you discuss the rights that non-citizen nationals have? Because that clearly wouldn't go in the citizenship article since they're not citizens. The only appropriate place would be... the nationality law articles.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Never really thought about it, but off the top of my head, I would say that depends on whether it is a domestic right <i>in</i> a country (like that owning property thing in New Zealand) or an international right <i>outside</i> of the country that gives the nationality/citizenship, like protected migration or asylum. We can brainstorm about it on your talk page, if you like.

<p>Colonial-era policy:
</p>
<ul><li>"law during this time was uncodified" is confirmed by the source, but the fact that it was based upon common law and precedent is not. Those are confirmed in McMillan &amp; Hood, p 2, or Karatani p. 41 thus add citation.</li></ul>

<ul><li>"Additionally, foreign women who married" did they lose their nationality of origin? Were they required to take an oath of allegiance and did that negate their original nationality? (I totally get that there may not be sources but based on my own work on the topic, usually acquisition in this period was without consent and with the consequence of losing their original nationality)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Nevermind. Fransman, p 137 says it did not result in loss of other nationality. I don't know if it is worth mentioning that NZ did not adopt the 1870 British Nationality Act (which did require women to lose their original nationality).<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/nationality-and-naturalisation">[36]</a>

<ul><li>"Franchise qualification" Bourassa &amp; Strong state on 234-235 that individual title was required to vote. Perhaps you should clarify that it isn't just owning land, but an individual property qualification? (and fix the citation, which only shows p 233, rather than 233-235.)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Voters of partial Māori descent" source specifies only males. While I note that you stated above women were enfranchised in 1893, the implication is that the system in 1867 was only racially discriminatory, when in fact it also discriminated on the basis of gender. Perhaps: The laws restricted voting, allowing only males to participate. It assigned "[v]oters of partial Māori descent" "to an electorate…"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I changed it to "Male voters..." and "Men who were exactly half-Māori..." to express that point without being too verbose.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Works for me, thank you.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I note that most of the sourcing in "Discriminatory policies against Chinese migrants" is to the acts themselves. Any secondary treatment available? Perhaps, if <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/poll-tax-imposed-on-chinese">this</a> is by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nzonscreen.com/profile/george-andrews/biography">this George Andrews</a> it is a RS.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Added more secondary sourcing.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Good.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>My reading of Tagupa is that 1923 and 1928 did not restrict Samoan status to naturalization, i.e. "… it would be right to say that they deprecate the automatic bestowal of the nationality of the mandatory power upon the inhabitants of the mandated territory," if they were born after its passage. p 23 (You can find more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://heinonline-org.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/HOL/Page?public=true&amp;handle=hein.journals/vuwlr17&amp;div=38&amp;start_page=345&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults">pp=364-365</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://heinonline-org.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/HOL/Page?public=true&amp;handle=hein.journals/otago5&amp;div=27&amp;start_page=367&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults">pp=367-368</a> if you sign in to the Wikipedia Library. Basically, in the Lesa case, the court concluded that indeed the law, "[made] British subjects by birth those persons who were born in Western Samoa while the two Acts were successively in force". Brookfield, 367) In spite of the fact, that the mandate prohibited them from extending their nationality to inhabitants of a mandated territory, (Tagupa, p 21) NZ apparently did just that, which might be worth mentioning.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Added mention of commission recommendation and tweaked the phrasing a bit on the earlier part. See if that works.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Better. Thanks!</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Imperial common code:
</p>
<ul><li>"The Imperial Parliament brought" is cited to primary. Baldwin, p 527 confirms info in a secondary source, which you might want to add to reduce reliance on primary sources.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"lost her British nationality through marriage could renaturalise" sounds as if she was naturalized to begin with. Baldwin says only she could naturalize without a residency requirement. The issue was that having stolen her nationality, she now had <i>an option to repatriate, if she naturalized</i>. It's an important distinction because she has to qualify; it's neither automatic nor is there a guarantee that she will regain her nationality, as pointed out by Mercer p 35</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Changed "renaturalise" to "reacquire that status".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Fine.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Changing relationship with Britain:
</p>
<ul><li>"New Zealand enacted the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 to create its own citizenship" should be nationality requirements. Citizenship is defined in domestic statutes, and as far as I am aware, do not go into effect until a person reaches majority, thus throughout the paragraph, it should probably read nationals and nationality.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Then... I would still be describing New Zealand citizens as British nationals here until 1977?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>No, I would say "New Zealand enacted the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 to create its own <i>nationality requirements</i>." Sorry if I wasn't clear.
<dl><dd>McMillan &amp; Hood p 3 has a clear statement, which might bring clarity, "a 'nationally'-construed political community", rather than a system of "peoples supposedly united by their loyalty to the same monarch". Perhaps you can just change "to create its own citizenship" to "to create a nationality system binding citizens to the <a href="/wiki/Polity" title="Polity">polity</a>" or something similar. It's significant as their relationship is to each other, not to a ruler.
<dl><dd>That's great and all but doesn't discuss the post-1948 nationality system in those terms. Every source that has been used in this article describes New Zealand nationals only as citizens and does not distinguish between the two concepts. I'm hesitant to change the wording on all of this because the sources cited cannot verify that. If there is no reliable source that discusses all of this explicitly, I feel like we'd be treading in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ORIGINAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ORIGINAL">WP:ORIGINAL</a> territory.
<dl><dd>I am really not trying to make this difficult, but the fact remains that it is. Widespread misuse of the terms has created confusion. Maybe you simply cite <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/nationality-and-naturalisation">this</a> in the lede after the discussion about the difference of the two terms in legal definition with something that says primarily "Since 1948, New Zealand has used citizen and citizenship to describe nationals in their nationality laws". And then throughout the article call them citizens. I think it is more difficult for readers, but I don't have another solution. <a href="/wiki/User:SusunW" title="User:SusunW">SusunW</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:SusunW" title="User talk:SusunW">talk</a>) 18:01, 29 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the citations to secondary sourcing. I note that McMillan &amp; Hood, p 6 does not mention "Irish citizens", but Wade p 70 or Thwaites p 9 does. Please add the cite.</dd>
<dd>"Commonwealth and Irish women who were married", as well as the discretionary approval, are discussed on Wade p 72. Please add cite to this sentence and the one following.</dd>
<dd>"Wives of New Zealand citizens who held foreign nationality, as well as their minor children", reads as if the foreign wife's children are automatically New Zealanders. Unless they were the husband's children, they weren't entitled to nationality. I think you mean to say "Foreign wives and children of New Zealanders were allowed to register", which is supported by McMillan &amp; Hood, p 6 "born to a father who had been born or naturalised in New Zealand" and at discretion to Wade p 72.
<dl><dd>Ehh, we can find another secondary source for this. Wade and Thwaites are talking about UK and Australian regulations on those pages, not New Zealand requirements.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>"All other foreign nationals could acquire" needs a secondary citation.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I am confused by page numbering associated with McMillan 2015. You cite "Voting rights were extended" to p 103. While that might be the case if the url was to the book, the url is for the chapter excerpt which is numbered 1-27. I do find the information on p 3, but there is no such page as 103.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Changed this.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Transition to national citizenship:
</p>
<ul><li>I am not sure about "While there have been formal reviews…the oath remains unchanged". First, citing to the actual oath does not tell us it has or has not changed. But second, the link to the "Oaths Modernisation Bill" says it will change the oath to loyalty to NZ and NZ values, while respecting that those values include loyalty to the Queen.(Main reforms). However, I am unclear as to whether the bill passed or did not pass. At the top it says <i>discharged on 01 June 2010</i> what does that mean? If failed, that would be your citation for "remains unchaged", but if it means it passed then did in not change in 2010?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I cited the Bill specifically because it did <i>not</i> pass and it's meant as a reference in contrast to the existing oath.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Except that requires drawing a conclusion. Thus, the statement should be cited to the Oaths Modernisation Bill.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I don’t find a citation for ending birthright citizenship at Sawyer 671. 653 says <i>automatic</i> birthright citizenship ended and 654 says NZ combines jus soli and jus sanguinis, and confirms that was a trend in commonwealth nations.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Fixed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Children born in New Zealand" citation is clearly incorrect. 2006 law cannot be confirmed in a 1977 piece of legislation. It is confirmed however, in Sawyer p 653. Fix citation please.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>The Citizenship Act 1977 as cited is the consolidated law containing all amendments from 1977 until today. Just because the title contains the year doesn't mean that the information in it is all from that year, as in other Commonwealth countries. However, I changed the primary source to the 2005 amending Act to clarify it, in addition to citing Sawyer.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Cool.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Strongly suggest that you do not cite everything following "In 1982, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council" to the actual case files. Interpreting law is tricky. Above links given for <a href="/wiki/Alison_Quentin-Baxter" title="Alison Quentin-Baxter">Alison Quentin-Baxter</a> and F. M. Brookfield should provide secondary analysis.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Supplemented with secondary sourcing.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The Cook Islands became", again all sources in this paragraph are primary. Cook Islands is confirmed by McMillan &amp; Hood, p 11; Niue on McMillan &amp; Hood, p 12; Foreign affairs McMillan &amp; Hood, p 11; and retaining NZ nationality McMillan &amp; Hood, pp 11-12</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Added secondary sourcing.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>Acquisition and loss of citizenship: 
</p>
<ul><li>"Nationality regulations apply" citation is to the act itself. Dawson p 201 (linked above) verifies the information that it is throughout NZ territory and says also extended to those born on aircraft or ships registered in the country or belonging to the government. McMillan &amp; Hood p 3 lists all the nations in the "realm".</li>
<li>"Individuals born within the Realm receive New Zealand citizenship at birth", see comment above, citizenship begins at majority, I’m fairly sure you mean nationality and shouldn't this be qualified as Since 2006, "individuals born…" and cited to Sawyer 653?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I get that you're drawing a line between nationality and citizenship on generic terms, totally get that. Not sure how that reads to an ordinary layperson or how to incorporate that distinction correctly into prose when these terms are <i>so</i> conflated in the Anglosphere. It does not help that the government also literally talks about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.govt.nz/browse/passports-citizenship-and-identity/nz-citizenship/types-of-citizenship-grant-birth-and-descent/">citizenship by birth</a>. Sawyer 653 wouldn't support talking about nationality either because nowhere on that page does she mention the word "nationality".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I know, it's insanely difficult. As for governments, they are people and typically not academics or legal scholars, so they also conflate the terms. In the European University Institute's series of "Report on Citizenship Law: Foo", all of the Latin American authors explained that they were told to use citizenship for the project, despite the fact that the topic was nationality and called that in their laws. British academic, Bronwyn Manby, who has written extensively on Africa stated that in her early versions of "Citizenship Law in Africa" she used citizenship, but in her later versions opted to use nationality to clarify that the comparison is about belonging and not domestic rights (but she didn't rename the series).&#160;;) As a general rule, if a source uses the words synonymously, the context determines if it is nationality or citizenship being discussed.
<dl><dd>Does the line added in the lead address this sufficiently?</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>The rest of the section also appears to be cited to the 1977 Act itself. I am fairly sure that by combining McMillan &amp; Hood, Dawson, and Sawyer you can convert most of the citations to secondary sources and I'll be happy to review it again once that has been done.</li></ul>
<p>Rights and restrictions:
</p>
<ul><li>Entire section is referenced to primary sources. However, that being said, I am not sure that a discussion of domestic rights is relative to the topic of Nationality law, as they have nothing to do with how one legally acquires or loses nationality. You may want to consider removing this section and revising it to concern only issues effecting migration, which clearly are the subject of international, rather than domestic law.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>It seems entirely relevant to me for something to be mentioned about the domestic rights a person would have since you are by definition a New Zealand citizen if you have New Zealand nationality.</li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">which clearly are the subject of international, rather than domestic law</q> This seems odd to bring up because a national of a country only has that status because of domestic law.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>I don't disagree with what you are saying about domestic statutes defining who are both, but this article is about nationality law. Nationality law is defined in domestic statutes but basically identifies to all other international actors "belonging" and what legal protections individuals are afforded anywhere in the world. If I am/live abroad in country Y, I cannot go the the government of Y and have them enforce my right to vote, work, travel, etc. which my country of origin X, grants me as a citizen. I can however, obtain from country Y, basic rights granted by international agreements based upon my nationality in X. Citizenship and domestic rights are a separate topic, i.e. is there discussion of what rights one receives as a citizen in the nationality law? My scan of the NZ statute mentions only the right of non-citizens to hold property, but I could be persuaded if they are deliniated.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Not sure I understand this sentence "New Zealand citizens without residency in the other Realm countries do not have an automatic right to live or work in there". To work where? In New Zealand or in the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau? I think from the citations you mean the latter, but the sentence needs to specify. Rather than cite to the acts, McMillan &amp; Hood, p 11 says NZers don't have rights to residency in Cook Islands and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/NZYbkIntLaw/2011/9.html">this</a> also notes they don't have residency rights in Niue or Tokelau. (Also has some interesting notes on parts of the 1977 law which are still in play in these places that are no longer valid in NZ itself).</li>
<li>Australia section, <i>New Zealanders in Australia: A Quick Guide</i>, is not as far as I can tell a publication of Parliament. Looks to me as if independent researchers rather than parliamentarians compiled the report, i.e. by Susan Love and Michael Klapdor published in <i>Research Paper Series</i>, vol 2019-2020, issn=2203-5249, which is produced by the Parliamentary Library in Canberra? It confirms the information in the rest of the paragraph and were it me, I'd cite to it rather than to the government travel advisory notice which has no author and is definitely a government publication.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Changed citations to refer to this paper.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I am confused as to what Australian's holding dual nationality have to do with New Zealand? Are they barred from holding office in New Zealand? That would be relevant, but the fact that they cannot hold office in Australia does not seem to be pertinent to New Zealand nationality. I would delete this paragraph unless dual nationality impacts them in New Zealand.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Comment: I note that while you discussed <a href="/wiki/Multiple_citizenship" title="Multiple citizenship">dual nationality</a> about Australia, there is no section dealing with New Zealand’s policy on the issue. I would expect to find both it and a section on "Loss of Nationality", as it is defined in NZ law in a comprehensive article on nationality law. (Loss is covered in McMillan &amp; Hood, pp 16-17)
<dl><dd>It's at the bottom of "Acquisition and loss of citizenship".
<dl><dd>Sorry, I missed it. Cited to the Act. Please cite to secondary sources.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>UK section, again I would not put domestic rights in an article about international law. Are there pertinent migration issues, i.e. visas, lack of visas, residency waivers etc. that should be included?</li></ul>
<p>That's it for me. Thank you so much for your work on the article. Happy to discuss any of the points or clarify my thoughts if it isn't clear. Overall, really well written and I appreciate that it is difficult to find sources. I was so happy to discover that we have access to the HeinOnline collections through the WP Library.

<p>Great to see this here, some initial comments below (going to jump around a lot):
</p>
<ul><li>"demonstrates a shift in Copland's style towards polytonality and serialism"—not clear what it's shifting <i>from</i>, persay. My guess what be neoclassicism, but perhaps you have a more succinct qualifier
<ul><li>I've consulted my sources, and I couldn't say for sure either. Instead of implying a shift, I just said that Copland developed an interest in serialism, and that the symphony incorporated influences from that interest. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>I see, the new wording is definitely an improvement; however, we might want to make it clear that this interest is a new one, perhaps "the composer's increasing interest" or "the composer's emerging interest"? <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 18:26, 9 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>I agree, done. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 02:23, 10 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>In order to sum up the article fully, I would include something brief about the nature of the ensemble size (e.g. to sum up the instrumentation section). It seems somewhat standard forces; besides the addition of heckelphone and piano as well as absence of low brass
<ul><li>Done <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<li>I would add a brief snippet about recordings to the lead. Maybe something like "The work has been recorded a few times, including two with Copland conducting"

<li>I will admit, I'm a bit confused by Copland's quote on percussion; is the irony that he <i>did</i> use percussion by using piano, or is he getting at something else? Perhaps a little context to clarify, but maybe this is just me
<ul><li>I'm kind of confused as well; it's not too clear in the thesis. I'll omit for now. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>But alas, it would be <i>really</i> nice to see any amount of actual music in the article. Any theme (well, preferably multiple); is this something you have a way of doing? If you know what you'd include, I could figure out something in Finale myself if it's any assistance
<ul><li>Yeah, I've never really figured out how to properly do this on Wikimedia Commons (even uploading paintings for me is kind of confusing, with the licensing and all that). I guess the first few bars of each movement would do fine, since that's what most other articles do. Besides that, I don't have anything else in mind. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>This feels like a must; I'm happy to assist—if you can give me some exact measure numbers and movement requests I'll see what I can do... <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 18:26, 9 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Thanks for offering to help. I was going to name the measure numbers, but only now did I realize that since this was an orchestral piece, it wouldn't be as easy as dropping measure numbers. I went ahead with just doing it myself based on Hilliard's analysis. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 02:23, 10 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Looks great!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>We should give some translations somewhere for the Italian tempos

<li>I'm not sure that the link on "Copland Conducts Copland (MS-7223)" to <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Masterworks_Records" title="Columbia Masterworks Records">Columbia Masterworks Records</a> makes sense, it seems misleading. Perhaps link just the "(MS-7223)" to Columbia Masterworks Records or maybe the earlier "Columbia" instead

<li>If that is truly a complete discography, then I struggle to rationale its need for a separate article. Regardless though, it should be included that Copland recorded again with the LSO and some of the more notable orchestras could be briefly mentioned, perhaps the SFS and NBC? I presume some of the chamber groups were using the chamber version?—might be notable as well.
<ul><li>I kept the two articles separate so that the cite styles could remain the same (this main article uses exclusively short refs, which I'm not sure how to apply for the All Music links). Also, the 1991 recording is likely not a second performance (Copland died in 1990) but rather a re-release of the 1969 recording (can't tell though, since I don't have access to it). <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>"The performance of the symphony in the recording" is somewhat clunky, is their a way to smooth this out, perhaps combining with the earlier sentence (maybe with a semi colon?)
<ul><li>Done. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 07:53, 5 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Hmmm, given his earlier association with the work I would definitely add that Stokowski recorded it, though I'm not sure when, as I don't know that he did so 30 years after his death like the discography suggests! <a href="/wiki/User:Aza24" title="User:Aza24">Aza24</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aza24" title="User talk:Aza24">talk</a>) 00:47, 5 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Yes, the discography gives the release date of the record only, not the recording/performance date.

<p>Music examples: the norm for FAs about concert works is that they have illustrative excerpts from the printed score, sound clips, or both. I imagine getting usable sound clips would be difficult, but you can certainly use small extracts from the printed score. Otherwise, no complaints about the musical analysis, which is clear and as jargon-free as such things ever can be if they are to be thorough.
</p><p>A few points on the prose:
</p>
<ul><li>Copland later arranged the symphony as a sextet to make it more playable – does  this mean making it available for more performances?
<ul><li>Sort of, I specified that he made it less difficult to play. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 15:50, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Others agreed with Copland's assessment, however – this is the first of nine "howevers" in the text. All nine could advantageously be removed. None of them add anything useful and they clutter the prose.
<ul><li>I disagree that "none of them add anything useful", since they are used to clarify otherwise contrasting/conflicting statements and improve logical flow. I did cut some of them out where they did appear unnecessary, reducing the total down to 4  "however"s spread roughly evenly over the article. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 15:50, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>While staying at the Yaddo estate – is the location of any relevance?
<ul><li>I mean, where Copland composed the piece should be included wherever possible. It does not have any explicit connection to anything else in the article, but it's a fact that should still be included I feel (like the exact date of the work's premiere for example). <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 15:50, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>in the fall of 1932 – the manual of style bids us avoid dating events by reference to the season, as our readers in the southern hemisphere have their seasons the other way about. If you have a month, excellent, otherwise "towards the end of" would perhaps be better than "in the fall of". (I think the mention of "the fall season", later on is fair enough.)
<ul><li>My source only specifies as far as "fall of 1932". I don't think "towards the end of" would be better than "in the fall of", however, since readers probably have an even greater variation in what they consider "towards the end of" a year to be (some may consider it to be just the month of December, or even Christmas-time, which isn't even fall). Context here that Copland is in <i>Mexico</i> should be enough for all readers (regardless of hemisphere) to judge what time/month period we're referring to. <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 15:50, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>declined to premiere … agreed to conduct the work's world premiere… It premiered in Mexico City – three premieres in a row. A bit of a variety would be welcome.

<li>Koussevitzky allegedly replied "Non ce n'est pas trop difficile, c'est impossible!" – seems surprising: why would Koussevitzky, who was Russian, speak to Copland in French?
<ul><li>Koussevitzky was Russian-born, but lived/worked most of his life elsewhere (e.g. he spent considerable time in France). "Serge" is actually the French-language spelling of "Sergei", so I wouldn't be surprised if he could speak French (I couldn't actually find a source explicitly saying so, though). <a href="/wiki/User:GeneralPoxter" title="User:GeneralPoxter">GeneralPoxter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GeneralPoxter" title="User talk:GeneralPoxter">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter" title="Special:Contributions/GeneralPoxter">contribs</a>) 15:50, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

I don't know if it was fan craziness...</q> I think maybe this quote would work better in a quote box to the right, as it is pretty long, and also summarizes the background quite well.

<li>Note sure where the AIDS thing plays in. In the following sentence, it says Starlin filled the suggestion box with papers saying to kill off Todd. Was the intent to kill him off <i>from AIDS</i>? It's not clear.
<ul><li>Yeah the idea was to kill off a DC character using AIDS for AIDS education (a respectful way to handle the topic, amirite?). I've reworded the sentence to say "... requested that writers submit suggestions for characters to kill off from AIDS." If this still needs work in your view just let me know. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 12:00, 7 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Starlin wrote scripts for a six-part story, and the decision was made to publish the first two parts in a single issue and the next two parts in the following issue to speed up the story because of the reader participation angle.</q> I was a little confused reading this, maybe because I'm not familiar with comics very much. Are "parts" normally not published together, meaning the original intent was to publish across six issues? Was it still in six parts or were the parts combined? Was this an unusual practice? Maybe this could be made <i>a little</i> more clear (without getting much more wordy).
<ul><li>Comic book stories are usually serialized a part per issue. In this case, DC decided to publish four parts (which would've been four issues normally) in double-sized issues. I've reworded it to: "Starlin wrote scripts for a six-issue story, and the decision was made to combine the first four across two issues..." Hopefully this is clearer. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 22:14, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Also, regarding the same phrase, the part "because of the reader participation angle"...I'm not understanding why they would need to rush the story because of the audience participation. Did the 900 numbers cost a lot of money and they wanted to get it done ASAP to cut the lines?
<ul><li>O'Neil's exact quote on the matter is: "The whole idea was reader participation, so speeding up the story-telling process by publishing double-issues seemed in the spirit of it all." My interpretation of this is that the Batman team felt like the story needed to be faster since fans were participating. I've reworded it to: "... to speed up the story because fans were participating." <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 22:14, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>When you mentioned the numbers on the backcover, I would mention that specific times on when to call were also printed. The first time you mentioned the numbers on the back, I assumed they were open for a month, or whatever the timing for an issue was. When I came across the line saying the lines were only open for 35 hours, I felt confused, like they only opted to get a small sampling of callers. Only when I saw the image of the back cover online, did I understand.
<ul><li>I added the specific times. I used EST because DC was headquartered in NYC at the time. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 22:14, 9 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">"the letters pages broke out into debate" over whether...</q> By "letters pages", I assume you mean pages in the comics where they publish letters sent in by fans? It's kind of a strange term that I had to think about for a second. Maybe say: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">fan letters published in the comic "broke out into debate" over whether...</q>
<ul><li>The quote is referring to <a href="/wiki/Comic_book_letter_column" title="Comic book letter column">comic book letter columns</a>, which are (or were, I don't know if publishers still do it) where the editors published and responded to letters from fans. I've changed it to say "the <i>Batman</i> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book_letter_column" title="Comic book letter column">letter column</a> "broke out into debate" over whether Todd should live or die", with the link. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 01:27, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Regarding the same sentence above, am I understanding right that upon the announcement of the storyline, fans already understood that the nature of the storyline was Robin's death, and began debating from that? I'm just thinking if they had to have some previous knowledge, but I don't know how they would. They didn't know he was at death's doorstep until 427, and the next issue he died, so these fan letters would not have much opportunity to debate.
<ul><li>Well, here's the thing that the source doesn't mention: DC announced the story a few months in advance, after <i>The Killing Joke</i> came out (<i>The Killing Joke</i> came out in March or May if I'm not mistaken). They originally didn't reveal that it was Todd who was in danger when they announced the story, fans at the time just <i>immediately</i> figured out that it was him. It didn't become official that it was going to be about Robin when <i>Batman</i> #426 was published that August. I hope this clears it up, I'm fine with scrubbing the sentence altogether, or adding the release date of <i>The Killing Joke</i> so it becomes clear it was some time in advance. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 01:27, 12 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>OK. Not required, but may be better to say: <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">...the <i>Batman</i> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book_letter_column" title="Comic book letter column">letter column</a> immediately concluded the storyline concerned Todd and "broke out into debate" over...</span> Which brings the clarity that fans concluded he was the subject by themselves, and brings the nuance that perhaps they deep down expected/wanted him to be the subject. But the writing here is not terribly misleading, and I'm not sure what the source says exactly, so I'll leave that to you to decide. <a href="/wiki/User:TarkusAB" title="User:TarkusAB"><span style="color: #000000"><b>TarkusAB</b></span></a><sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TarkusAB" title="User talk:TarkusAB"><span style="color: #aa0000"><b>talk</b></span></a>/<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TarkusAB" title="Special:Contributions/TarkusAB"><span style="color: #aa0000"><b>contrib</b></span></a></sup> 04:57, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Others lamented how bloodthirsty comic book readers had become.</q> Maybe I'm reading too much into "had become", but were there other cases at the time of readers wanting character deaths in their comics?
<ul><li>I've changed it to "were", because I can see how this can be a bit confusing if you're not familiar with comics history. Basically, the death of Robin came early during the <a href="/wiki/Modern_Age_of_Comic_Books" title="Modern Age of Comic Books">Modern Age of Comic Books</a>, a time when it was really cool and trendy to have your comic as brutally bloody and violent as possible. Weldon mentions in his book that upon hearing that Robin could be killed, many fans jumped at the opportunity because they wanted the mainstream Batman comics to be as savage and adult as <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Watchmen" title="Watchmen">Watchmen</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 01:27, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Now towards the end of the article, I'm getting the impression that Todd is a child, or at least was in this storyline. Is that mentioned earlier, and did I just miss it? I think his age (or at least the fact that he's a teen/child) should be mentioned in the Background section if that is the case, as it brings a fascinating spin.
<ul><li>Yeah, Robin is almost always depicted as an adolescent. According to <i>The Batman Files</i>, Todd was canonically 15 during this storyline, so he was still a child. I've added that Robin is an adolescent to the introductory sentence in Background. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 01:27, 12 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Shouldn't the fact that Todd was brought back to life as the Red Hood be in the lead? Seems important
<ul><li>I've added it. I also threw in that Tim Drake replaced Todd as I felt that was important for context as well. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 12:00, 7 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dl><dd>No problem. You put so much work into these articles, I knew it would be a good read. The only comic I was ever subscribed to was the <i>Sonic</i> Archie series when I was young, and those were meh. Reading about mature comics like this, I can see how good comic book writers and artists can really push the boundaries of artistic expression, and it gives me an appreciation for the medium I didn't have before.

<ul><li>Throughout this article, you mainly talk about "A Death in the Family" and rarely about <i>Batman: A Death in the Family</i>—and rightly so. But the article title should reflect this; I recommend moving the article to <a href="/wiki/A_Death_in_the_Family_(Batman)" class="mw-redirect" title="A Death in the Family (Batman)">A Death in the Family (Batman)</a> (or whatever is appropriate). I also feel "collected in trade paperback form as <i>Batman: A Death in the Family</i>" should be relegated from the first sentence to the fourth paragraph of the lead. The collected TPB is simply not very important compared to that of the story of <i>Batman</i> #426–429.
<ul><li>I definitely agree with this. Do you think <a href="/wiki/A_Death_in_the_Family_(comics)" title="A Death in the Family (comics)">A Death in the Family (comics)</a> would be a suitable move? <a href="/wiki/A_Death_in_the_Family_(Batman)" class="mw-redirect" title="A Death in the Family (Batman)">A Death in the Family (Batman)</a> could definitely work, but there is no other comic book storyline with the same title, so I don't think we'd need to be as specific (and "(comics)" is more standard across WP). I would suggest moving to <a href="/wiki/A_Death_in_the_Family" title="A Death in the Family">A Death in the Family</a> but the novel is probably more notable. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 12:18, 15 August 2021 (UTC)

<li>There's an abrupt segue from "the reboot characterized Todd as rebellious and impulsive" to O'Neil wanting to setup a public voting system (which comes out of nowhere).

<ul><li>What makes <a href="/wiki/Looper_(website)" class="mw-redirect" title="Looper (website)"><i>Looper</i></a> a high-quality source or one that would be appropriate for a featured article? There was <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_270#Reliability_level_of_Looper.com?" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 270">a discussion</a> about this site on the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RSN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RSN">WP:RSN</a>, but that could just be one editor's opinion. My concern is that one of the <i>Looper</i> citations (i.e. Citation 8) is used rather frequently in the article to support factual information. I am not saying this is a bad source or it should be removed or anything that extreme. I just want to get your rationale for its use in a FAC/FA space.
<ul><li><i>Looper</i> is owned by <a href="/wiki/ZergNet" title="ZergNet">ZergNet</a>, and we consider its sister site <i>SVG</i> reliable (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:VG/S" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:VG/S">WP:VG/S</a>). Their <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.looper.com/policies/">policy page</a> lists strict adherence to fact-checking and accuracy and always providing sources for claims. Additionally, the primary <i>Looper</i> reference I cited was written by Chris Sims, a published author who's written for multiple reliable sources. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 15:56, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>For Citation 16 and 18, I would avoid putting the title in all caps, even if the sources themselves do that. If there are other instances of this that I have missed in the citations, then please correct them as well.</li>
<li>For Citation 46, wouldn't <a href="/wiki/ComiXology" title="ComiXology">ComiXology</a> be considered the platform rather than the publisher? I would think it should go in the "via=" parameter while <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> should be in the "publisher=" parameter. I would think this would be a similar case to how <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> is represented in Citation 65.</li>
<li>Why use <i><a href="/wiki/Den_of_Geek!" class="mw-redirect" title="Den of Geek!">Den of Geek!</a></i>, which is a redirect, rather than <i><a href="/wiki/Den_of_Geek" title="Den of Geek">Den of Geek</a></i>?</li>
<li>When looking through the citations, I noticed there was not any scholarly or academic coverage. I did a brief <a href="/wiki/Google_Scholar" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a> search, and I found items such <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74989-7_10">72 Votes: Theorizing the Scapegoat Sidekick in <i>Batman: A Death in the Family</i></a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/78b996427928a291023fcf5b2da8936b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=34704">Arab images in American comic books</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42980513">Holy Islamophobia, Batman!

<ul><li>I'm working on incorporating them right now. I did want to point out though—there's <i>shockingly</i> little scholarly coverage of the story, to the point that the first sentence of the Tembo article is "There has been surprisingly little scholarly attention paid towards the death of arguably the most famous sidekick in comic book history". <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 12:20, 8 September 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Thank you for the update. I am also surprised there is little scholarly coverage given how big this storyline was. If there is just not scholarly coverage, then it is understandable why those sources are not really used in this article. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 17:29, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>On a similar note about coverage, I am somewhat surprised Dennis O'Neil's "It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back." quote/defense is not used in the article since it was published on the back cover of the trade paperback. Is there a reason for its absence?
<ul><li>I didn't include it because overall, I didn't really deem it important to understanding the story. I did find some commentary in <i>Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City</i> connecting it to how Todd's death was intended to remain permanent so I will see if I can incorporate that. <a href="/wiki/User:TheJoebro64" title="User:TheJoebro64"><small style="color:red">JOE</small></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:TheJoebro64" title="User talk:TheJoebro64"><small>BRO</small></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64" title="Special:Contributions/TheJoebro64"><span style="color:#D18719">64</span></a> 16:04, 6 September 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Fair point. I could understand why the quote itself is not particularly necessary. Thank you for the explanation for that. I think it would be helpful to add a brief part about his death was intended to be permanent. <a href="/wiki/User:Aoba47" title="User:Aoba47">Aoba47</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aoba47" title="User talk:Aoba47">talk</a>) 19:29, 6 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Everything else looks to me. Aside from my question about <i>Looper</i>, the citations seem appropriate for a featured article on a comic book storyline (as context does matter with that), and they are well-structured. I greatly appreciate the time stamp for Citation 52. I have looked through some of the citations (i.e. spot checks) and the information is supported. I will do a few more tomorrow just to make sure.

<li>"A girl playing football was still unusual at the time" - is this really true?

Do you mean that a girl playing <i>for a boys' team</i> was unusual?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I guess it's all relative. Say a club with 15 boys' teams would just about be able to form 1 girls' team. Or in another way (pardon my guessing numbers here for mid 1990s): 75 out of 100 boys played at a club versus 5 out of a 100 girls. Which is low compared to current levels, but high compared to 1970s and 1980s ... The source says unusual. Other sources also mention unusual. Would you like to modify it with "somewhat"? <a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Edwininlondon" title="User talk:Edwininlondon">talk</a>) 21:05, 12 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dt>Early life</dt></dl>
<ul><li>The lead gives her full name as "Gabriëlla Maria "Manon" Melis". This info should also be here, and cited.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"the talented young Melis" - this feels a bit like editorialising. If sources say she was talented, then attribute it with a quote.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done: I removed talented</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"she later said that their teammates often ridiculed her direct opponents for having to compete against a girl" - this doesn't seem very clearly written. The "their teammates" is introduced before we know who's under discussion. I assume it means that whoever was assigned to mark her was ridiculed by the rest of that person's team? Anyway, please try to word more clearly.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done: your assumption is correct.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"In 2012, Melis observed" - I think it might be better to say "Melis later said"; the "in 2012" part gives the impression it's part of the same timeline. And "observed" is mentioned as a word to avoid at <a href="/wiki/MOS:SAID" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:SAID">MOS:SAID</a>.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis was a ball girl once at a national team match played at Sparta Rotterdam's venue Het Kasteel. From early on she has been a Feyenoord fan" - the language seems slightly unpolished here. Suggest something like "During her childhood, Melis appeared as a <a href="/wiki/Ball_boy" title="Ball boy">ball girl</a> during a national team match at the <a href="/wiki/Sparta_Stadion_Het_Kasteel" title="Sparta Stadion Het Kasteel">Sparta Stadion Het Kasteel</a>. She supported Feyenoord, one of her father's clubs, from an early age and has said that <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_van_Bronckhorst" title="Giovanni van Bronckhorst">Giovanni van Bronckhorst</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henrik_Larsson" title="Henrik Larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> were her favourite players during her youth."</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>RVVH</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"the senior level" - is there a link for this? It might not be entirely clear what this means.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I can't find anything appropriate. There is a page about <a href="/wiki/Youth_system" title="Youth system">youth system</a>, but nothing about senior level. Would you like me to redlink it?
<dl><dd>No, that's fine. I guess it's clear enough! &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 10:58, 1 September 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"the club's only women's team" - this sounds like you're talking about a single women's team, while the club has several men's teams. Is that what you meant to say, or did you mean a "women-only team"? Either way, it needs a bit of clarity.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Both actually. But to avoid confusion I removed only. Too much detail. Since we have just mentioned mixed, women's team is clear I think.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Teammate Leonne Stentler, who had joined her on the boys' teams and who ended up gaining 16 caps for the Dutch national team" - two things: (1) was it a boys' team, or was it a mixed team? (2) the prose could do with some improvement. Maybe something like "She was joined by <a href="/wiki/Leonne_Stentler" title="Leonne Stentler">Leonne Stentler</a>, who had also played for RVVH's mixed youth teams. Stentler, who went on to earn 16 <a href="/wiki/Caps_(sports)" class="mw-redirect" title="Caps (sports)">caps</a> for the Dutch national team, later said that the drop in level had negatively affected their motivation".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>1) it was mixed. I changed it. 2) ok, done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Other internationals at the club were Jeanine van Dalen and Sandra Muller" - were these internationals at the time, or later?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>At the time</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The women had to make their own way" - informal language, maybe something like "The women had to arrange their own travel to away games..."</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"RVVH did not win the league during Melis's tenure" - this sounds a little incomplete; were they a team which usually challenged for winning the league? What sort of positions did they finish in during Meelis's tenure, and how dit those compare with other seasons when she wasn't there?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>There is nothing I can find. All there seems to be from this time is a list of league winnrs for each year, no standings. This was not professional sport and had no mainstream media coverage.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Also, is there no information on how many games she played and how many goals?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Sadly not.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Be Quick '28</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"Her dream was to focus fully on football" - sounds a bit POV. Phrase in a neutral encyclopedic tone.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Rephrased: She wished to focus fully on football,</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"this offer meant that she would also have to find other work" - why was that? If she remained in the Netherlands would she not have to find other work?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>She wanted to become fully professional, not semi-professional, which is what this essentially was. Might as well stay an amateur in the Netherlands then until a better offer comes around, I guess was her thinking.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis only played for Be Quick for a few months" - it feels like a bit more detail is needed here. How many games did she play, how many goals etc and was it a successful time</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I wish I could find more detail, but sadly there are no records other than her moving to the club and leaving the club. Still amateur football.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>LdB FC Malmo</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"one of the strongest leagues in the world according to FIFA" → "described by FIFA as one of the world's strongest leagues"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"and ended up the club's top scorer" → "and finished as the club's top scorer"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"but her tally was dwarfed" - tweak language for encyclopaedic tone</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done: but her tally was surpassed by</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Umeå repeated as champions" - the term "repeating" sounds odd in British English, I think this is more of an Americanism. Maybe something like "Umeå retained the championship"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"during which Brazilian forward Marta was shown a red card" - don't really need this detail, as it has nothing to do with Melis</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done. removed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Suggested condensing of wording: "Melis shared the league's top-scorer spot that season with Umeå's <a href="/wiki/Marta_(footballer)" title="Marta (footballer)">Marta</a>, each of them scoring 23 times, although 6 of Marta's goals were scored on the last day of the season in an 11–1 win over already-relegated <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A4linge_IF" title="Bälinge IF">Bälinge</a>".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>The paragraph starting "in the 2009 season" could be combined with the previous one as it looks rather short.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I would prefer to keep each paragraph dedicated to one season. Should I try to find something of interest to add to the 2009 season paragraph?</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"recorded a notable stretch" - notable according to whom? Better just to state that it happened, without saying it was notable.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done. Removed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis scoring three goals for a hat-trick in one of them" - just saying she scored a hat-trick would be sufficient, as this is fairly usual terminology and there's a link for readers who don't know. Might be nice to say which of the three games she scored the hat-trick in, and against which opponents.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>In my previous football FAC a reviewer urged me to add the definition of a hat-trick in line. I merely copied that here. I am happy to take it away. Done. I added the opponent.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis finally won the league" - not sure we need "finally" here, it sounds slightly POV</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Removed.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis had hat-tricks in two key matches" - who defined these matches as "key"?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I did. Is it too editorial? Goteborg finished second and Umeå won the league multiple times in recent years, so I thought it was reasonably safe to say key. Better to say this perhaps: "Melis had hat-tricks in two matches against rival title candidates:"</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"She scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win" - perhaps "She also scored..."</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"in a notable 11–1 win over Asarum" - avoid saying "notable"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"In their description of the history of Damallsvenskan, the Swedish Football Association wrote that the 2010 season saw some stars leaving the league and, consequently, audience numbers declined, prompting a decrease in sponsor funds needed to attract new stars" - not sure what this has to do with Melis</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I think it is good to give some wider perspective on the women's game at the time. Ultimately she leaves the Swedish league for the US, with more stars, higher audience numbers, more sponsor money.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis again finished as Damallsvenskan's top scorer" - we said "again" in the previous paragraph, so sounds slightly repetitive here.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"For five straight seasons she was Malmö's top scorer" → "she has been Malmö's top scorer for five straight seasons"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis played her first ever Champions League game on 29 September 2011 in Italy against Tavagnacco" - what was the score?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>2-1 defeat. Added.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>That's it for the first tranche. I'll continued with Sky Blue FC once these are addressed... &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 12:02, 27 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thanks very much. Look forward to more. <a href="/wiki/User:Edwininlondon" title="User:Edwininlondon">Edwininlondon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Edwininlondon" title="User talk:Edwininlondon">talk</a>) 22:43, 27 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Sky Blue FC</dt></dl>
<ul><li>All looks good.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>Linköpings FC</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"also a fast player" - her being a fast player sounds a little like an opinion, rather than something objective; might be better to note and attribute the source which said they were both fast (apparently "fleet-footed" is the term they used!)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I removed it</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"The club did not start the season well, but she kept her scoring ability" - would be good to give a more information about this. Like how many goals, and how many defeats the team suffered etc.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>added "managing just two wins from the first eight games," and "scored four times in a 4–1 win over Piteå"</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis still did not see success in the domestic cup" - maybe rephrase to something like "Melis's lack of success in the domestic cup continued, as Linköping lost..."</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"at the venue she had played in for five years" - slightly awkward wording. Probably enough just to say it was an away game, or give the name of the stadium or something (I notice you name it several times further down).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>How about this: "In June she faced her old club Malmö at the Malmö IP stadium, where she had played for five years."</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Ref 66 isn't loading properly for me, even the archived version. I can't see any information on the page. Am I missing something?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>There seems to be a website glitch. Looks like the data from the database is not loading. I have alerted the website owners of the issue by email.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"mostly because of a hat-trick by German international Anja Mittag" → "with German international Anja Mittag scoring a hat-trick".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Malmo part 2</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"on an assist from Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir" - not sure if we really need this detail, given that Gunnarsdottir isn't mentioned anywhere else.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>What if I add a bit about Sara Björk, such as ", who later went on to win the UEFA Women's Champions League in 2018 with Lyon"? Extra things like that convey that Melis was playing with top quality players. Alternatively, I just remove the bit about the assist.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"in front of over 2,500 spectators" - slightly prefer "more than" rather than "over"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"seven points ahead of number two, Tyresö" - I think "second-placed" would sound better than "number two"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"two goals fewer than her teammate Mittag and 12 fewer than the league's top scorer Press" - per <a href="/wiki/MOS:NUM" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:NUM">MOS:NUM</a> it should be either 2 and 12, or two and twelve, as the numbers are comparable.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Also add a comma before Press</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Kopparbergs/Gotebord</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"The Dutchwomen's first competitive match together" - I assume this means Martens, Geurts and Melis. I would actually give the names for clarity.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis was offered and accepted a lucrative contract from Göteborg, despite being happy at Malmö" - lucrative sounds slightly a matter of opinion here. If possible, give the exact financial advantages. Also, it might be better to order it differently. Start with her being happy at Malmo, then say that Goteborg came in with an offer, and that she decided to accept it for financial reasons or whatever.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"including two goals on assists from Göteborg stalwart" → probably "long-term Göteborg player" rather than "stalwart"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis and Martens linking up for many years for the Netherlands national team" → "Melis and Martens' many years of experience together on the Netherlands national team"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"He had noticed in training how Martens would hold up the ball for an extra second so Melis could make her runs" - might be better as a quote from the coach, as the holding up for an extra second is an opinion rather than a fact.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I removed it. Not too sure about translating foreign language quotes, so just removing it is best.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"yielded a disappointing result" - this sounds like it's Wikipedia's opinion that the result was disappointing. Reword for NPOV.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"which had merged with" - maybe "who had merged"? I think we usually treat teams like they're a group of people rather than a single object.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"In a notable match in July 2014" - notable according to whom? And what was the eventual score?</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"because of a 3–2 defeat" → "as a result of a 3–2 defeat"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"in second place on the top scorers list, far behind Mittag, who scored 23 goals versus her 16" → "in second place on the top scorers list with 16 goals, substantially behind Mittag, who scored 23"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Melis's final season in Sweden, the 2015 Damallsvenskan, was a disappointment" - again, a disappointment for her, but not necessarily for Wikipedia.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Göteborg only ranked sixth on the table. Her old club Rosengård won the title again." - combine into one sentence, e.g. "Göteborg achieved only a sixth-place finish, as her former club Rosengård won the title again"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Seattle Reign FC</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Say which country this is in in the opening sentence. It might seem obvious, but best to state it explicitly, e.g. "in the American National Women's Soccer League"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"after landing wrongly on the pitch" - odd wording</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"She came back strong from injury" - should be "strongly" I think</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"in 16 appearances she scored seven times ... Watt topped the league's scorer's list with 11 goals" - either 7/11 or seven/eleven.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>That takes me on to "international career". &#160;&#8212;&#160;<a href="/wiki/User:Amakuru" title="User:Amakuru">Amakuru</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Amakuru" title="User talk:Amakuru">talk</a>) 12:35, 1 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dt>Early years</dt>
<dd>Euro 2009</dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Having represented the Netherlands at youth levels" - it would be good to have some brief detail on this, like when she was called up, which teams etc (the infobox says u-17 and u-19 teams).</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Against Belgium" - might be good to say "Her debut was against Belgium" or similar, just so we connect it with the date, which was mentioned two sentences ago.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"playing only three minutes" -&gt; "for the last three minutes" (assuming that's what it was)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"for the first time in her fourth cap ... Only in her 16th cap" - these are close enough together that it's worth matching, 4th/16th or fourth/sixteenth. Probably go for 4th/16th, since we later also see 34th cap.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"for a major tournament" - I think you could remove this</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>The word "tie" should be linked to the article <a href="/wiki/Two-legged_tie" title="Two-legged tie">Two-legged tie</a>, although I've realised this isn't the first occurrence, that would be up in the Malmo section "Melis scored once in the away leg of the tie", so please link it theere.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"the technically very capable French" - sounds like a matter of opinion; make it a quote, or reword</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"In the semi-finals England awaited" - unnecessary, you just said the semi-final was against England. It's also slightly journalese.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"In another tense game" - again, "tense" is an opinion</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"a Jill Scott header gave England a place in the final" - give the final score.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Prior to the Euro 2013 in Sweden" - we don't usually have "the" before "Euro 2013"</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>"Fortunately for the Dutch" - should probably just drop this; "fortunately" implies they had some luck with other results or something, but scoring the equaliser was actually in their own hands.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Done</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Managerial career</dt></dl>
<ul><li>"given that Miedema has been a lifelong Feyenoord fan" - change to "had" I think, for past tense</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>How about "is a Feyenoord fan". I don't want readers to think Miedema no longer is one.

<ul><li><strike>I will do a source review within the next two days which I believe will pass easily.</strike> One immediate comment is that I would not consider <i>TV Series Finale</i> a high-quality source because it does not have access to Nielsen ratings, it just copies from other sources. However, its ratings tables like the one cited in this article have also been cited in multiple books published by academic and university presses and I can't think of an alternative of higher quality for the info cited. <a href="/wiki/User:Heartfox" title="User:Heartfox">Heartfox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Heartfox" title="User talk:Heartfox">talk</a>) 00:10, 20 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Heartfox" title="User:Heartfox">Heartfox</a>:</span> Just to clarify on this, do you think <i>TV Series Finale</i> should be removed or kept? It seems to match all of the ratings information from <a href="/wiki/The_Good_Place_(season_3)" title="The Good Place (season 3)"><i>The Good Place</i> (season 3)</a>, which is sourced to <i><a href="/wiki/TV_by_the_Numbers" title="TV by the Numbers">TV by the Numbers</a></i>, so I am fairly confident it is reliable. However, I can also remove it and rework the section if needed. <a href="/wiki/User:RunningTiger123" title="User:RunningTiger123">RunningTiger123</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:RunningTiger123" title="User talk:RunningTiger123">talk</a>) 16:44, 22 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Like I said, because it is cited university press-published books I can't really argue that it must be excluded. Unless another editor considers it an issue, it's up to you. <a href="/wiki/User:Heartfox" title="User:Heartfox">Heartfox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Heartfox" title="User talk:Heartfox">talk</a>) 21:23, 25 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Per <a href="/wiki/MOS:CONFORMTITLE" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:CONFORMTITLE">MOS:CONFORMTITLE</a> bullet four, stuff like 'The Good Place' should be italicized in citation titles regardless if the publication has it in quote marks (e.g., refs 8, 22).
<ul><li>Done.</li></ul></li>
<li>I looked for Live+7 DVR in <i>Variety</i> and <i>TV by the Numbers</i>, but couldn't find any for the week the episode aired, so <i>Programming Insider</i> is fine.</li>
<li>What is the reliability of sfadb.com? Can two more established sources for the 2018 and 2020 Hugo Awards be cited instead?
<ul><li>sfadb.com is run by the same organization that publishes <i><a href="/wiki/Locus_(magazine)" title="Locus (magazine)">Locus</a></i>, which from my experience is a reputable source. I used that instead of finding sources for each year to avoid cluttering the sentence with excessive citations. (And if the show wins for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.tor.com/2021/04/13/announcing-the-2021-hugo-award-finalists/">its 2021 nomination</a>, it would be really easy to update the citation as opposed to finding another source to add there.)</li></ul></li>
<li>ref 22 missing author
<ul><li>Done.</li></ul></li>
<li>ref 23 episode title "The Book of Dougs" not given in source

<p>The carillon is an Old World musical instrument, emerging from centuries-old, interconnected traditions of bell-ringing, time-keeping, metalworking, and more. It is one of the only musical instruments that you cannot play in private—everyone in earshot must bear witness to your performance. There are fewer than 1,300 carillons worldwide according to the most generous counts; it is fascinating to learn about an instrument where the population is a critical component to its existence. One of the biggest struggles for those who love this instrument is to spread awarnesss of it. My teacher calls the carillon "the world's longest and best kept secret." What better way than to have a high-quality, encyclopedic article freely available for all!

I wasn't sure whether it should be mentioned both there and in the history section. Other than this, all that really happened was the construction of more carillons.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>" Royal Carillon School "Jef Denyn" " is at least double-linked</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>Comment:</b> It is linked twice (three times if we include the image caption, but as far as I'm aware, that one doesn't count). This was brought up in the <a href="/wiki/Talk:Carillon/GA1#Sources_and_other" title="Talk:Carillon/GA1">GAN</a>. My justification for the second link is that it is part of quite a bold statement: <span style="color:green;">...the Royal Carillon School "Jef Denyn" remains the most sought-after educational program for the carillon in the world.</span></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I would suspect the American public is most familiar with the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_Carillon" title="Netherlands Carillon">Netherlands Carillon</a> near Washington, D.C, since it is often visited on tourist trips through Arlington Cemetery.

<p>Spotchecks not done. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carillon&amp;oldid=1035082128">Version reviewed</a>
</p>
<ul><li>Some of the details in the lead don't appear to be supported in the text. For example, the lead states the instrument "experienced a peak in the mid-18th century"; the text has a much broader range for this peak.
<ul><li><b>Fixed.</b></li></ul></li>
<li>"Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to reproduce sustained notes expressively" - source?
<ul><li><b>Fixed.</b> The citation on the previous sentence also covered that one—whoops.</li></ul></li>
<li>What makes TowerBells a high-quality reliable source? Essential Vermeer?
<ul><li>TowerBells is as high-quality of a source as the WCF carillon registry and the Peace Carillons registry in that there is only one way to conduct these counts: mailing survey forms to towers that could potentially be housing bells. TowerBells was originally sponsored by the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA), but the curator chose to sever professional connections and publish the information themselves (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.gcna.org/publications">source for this claim</a>). Yes, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SPS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SPS">WP:SPS</a> comes to mind, however it is <em>THE</em> source that carillonneurs use for statistics and general knowledge. For example, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.gcna.org/resources/Documents/Carillon-News-2021-04.pdf">this message (page 3) from the GCNA president</a> cites TowerBells, long after the professional connection was severed. If we compare it to other registries, we can easily see that TowerBells is the <em>highest</em>-quality source. The WCF registry is clearly dated and of a lower quality than TowerBells.org. It lacks so much critical information on a particular carillon (year installed, history of renovations/upgrades, exact location, current and past players/owners, etc.) that TowerBells provides, and may not have been updated in many years, as newer carillons listed on TowerBells are not listed at the WCF. It goes without saying that the distribution of carillons across the world is arguably one of the most important talking points for this article. <b>TowerBells is the most rigorous and well-rounded source available.</b></li>
<li>Oops, I did not realize I was still citing Essential Vermeer. That article series was written in memory of André Lehr, and is largely based off his campanology textbook. I thought I replaced all the Vermeer citations with equivalent citations from Lehr's textbook – <b>Fixed.</b></li></ul></li>
<li>Several entities are entered in work title fields in the citation templates that would be better described as publishers - eg WCF. Please check throughout.
<ul><li><b>Fixed.</b> I was unsure about TowerBells.org, so I kept it under the website parameter.
<ul><li>Still some issues here, eg FN102. Also, Towerbells.org or TowerBells.org? <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nikkimaria" title="User talk:Nikkimaria">talk</a>) 00:35, 29 July 2021 (UTC)

<li>FN36: are there any independent sources supporting this claim? Ditto FN89
<ul><li>For FN36, I <b>added a source</b> from the GCNA corroborating the Kirk in the Hills carillon. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel that Kirk in the Hills describing the fact that it is tied with the Sout Korean carillon is neutral enough.
<ul><li>What specifically does the GCNA source say? <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nikkimaria" title="User talk:Nikkimaria">talk</a>) 00:35, 29 July 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>"<span style="color:green;">The Kirk-in-the-Hills 77-bell carillon is famous as the carillon with the world’s largest number of bells (bourdon 12,860 pounds [5,833 kg], note G).</span>" I imagine this will be a common question for future editors, so I added this quote to the citation. <a href="/wiki/User:Thrakkx" title="User:Thrakkx">Thrakkx</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thrakkx" title="User talk:Thrakkx">talk</a>) 00:59, 29 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>For FN89, there is no other source supporting the library's claim. Not surprising – it is an obscure library supporting a tiny community. I <b>reworded the sentence</b> about it from "<span style="color:green;">it contains one of the world's largest collections</span>" to "<span style="color:green;">it contains large collections</span>".</li></ul></li>
<li>Check that page ranges consistently use "pp" rather than "p", and be consistent in whether page ranges are abbreviated
<ul><li><b>Fixed.</b> I do not see any citations that deviate from the abbreviated method (e.g. 1##–##, 2##–##)</li></ul></li>
<li>How are you ordering entries in Internet?
<ul><li>The original intent was ordering by author last name if available, then alphabetical by title, but I see that has mostly fallen apart over time. <b>Now ordering alphabetically by title.</b></li></ul></li>
<li>Why so many External links entries?
<ul><li>I <b>removed</b> two links: Essential Vermeer (no longer needed) and TowerBells (already cited)</li></ul></li>
<li>How does Swager meet <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SCHOLARSHIP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SCHOLARSHIP">WP:SCHOLARSHIP</a>?
<ul><li>Swager wrote his dissertation while studying in Flanders as a Fullbright Scholar and also while in France under a (French) government grant. He <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.allegrofuoco.com/carillon.html">notes</a> that 1) made several Dutch-language sources available to English speakers via incorporating their information into his thesis and compiling a bibliography, and 2) he contacted a "national organization" of carillonneurs (likely the GCNA as he is American) to meet with other experts. As Indiana University itself had its carillon back then, I assume good faith in that the university had made available subject matter experts to review the dissertation. A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=9879230539789194869&amp;as_sdt=400005&amp;sciodt=0,14&amp;hl=en">quick search on Google Scholar</a> shows that his dissertation has been cited once in 2017. This is not significant for most topics, but for the carillon, which sees little research in comparison to other musical instruments, it is.</li></ul></li>
<li>The website for the North American Carillon School appears to be dead - is there any more information about this publisher?
<ul><li>I do not see what you mean here, the link in External links is up-to-date (they recently switched URLs from "carillonschoolusa.com" to "northamericancarillonschool.com", though I updated the link as soon as the new site went live). I removed "/home" from the URL in case that was causing an issue. Can you try again?</li></ul></li>

<p>Non-expert prose review.
</p>
<ul><li>"Though the word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players that are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used." I think it needs to specify earlier in the sentence that the article is talking about the French language. Perhaps, "The French language has a separate word for female carillon players (carilloneuse), but this was not adopted for the English language."
<ul><li><b>Comment:</b> I personally like the wording of this sentence, but I see your point. How about: "the French <i>carillonneuse</i> to denote women is not used <b>in English</b>."?

<li>"Denyn took over as the city carillonneur, who was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold's Cathedral." -&gt; "Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold's Cathedral." To remove a comma and flow.

<li>I'm surprised that there is nothing in the history section from post-WWII to 1999. Is there any significant history of the carillon to note for this period?
<ul><li><b>Comment:</b> most of the development during this period was with the repertoire. In the music section, it talks about the new, American approach to playing and writing music. I wasn't sure whether it should be mentioned both there and in the history section. Other than this, all that really happened was the construction of more carillons and the establishment of the World Carillon Federation (which is discussed in the Organization and education section).
<ul><li>I would add brief comments in the history section about the development of the North American style, and keep information in the music section focused on the characteristics and major composers of the North American style. I would also add information about the creation of the World Carillon Federation. Perhaps something like, "In the 1950s and 1960s, a North American style of carillon music emerged. Its creation was led by Ronald Barnes, a professor at the University of Kansas, who created new compositions for the instrument and encouraged his peers to compose for the instrument as well. In the 1970s, the World Carillon Federation was formed as the central organization for carillon players and their enthusiasts." Keeps it short, gives a history of this time period, and this information is expanded upon later. <a href="/wiki/User:Z1720" title="User:Z1720">Z1720</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Z1720" title="User talk:Z1720">talk</a>) 19:02, 3 August 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li><b>Added.</b> I placed the WCF blurb under "International recognition" as it is an international organization and felt most relevant there.

<li>"Only about 15 collections of carillon music written before 1900 are known to exist." Is there an exact number we can use here, instead of "Only about"?
<ul><li><b>Comment:</b> the source says "<span style="color:green;">Today some fifteen collections with music from the heyday of the carillon are extant.</span>" Using "heyday of the carillon" seems much too vague for this article, but I realize that using an exact year is actually incorrect. "Heyday" is referring to the period between the mid-17th and late-18th centuries. How about: "Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist."?

<ul><li>The source's "Remarks" says there are 51 bells in the tower; however two of them are swinging bells and not part of the carillon. "Technical data" right below reports that it is a 49-bell carillon. And again see the third bullet of the source review.</li></ul></li>

<li>119: I can't see the definition on the webpage mentioned.
<ul><li>Right, my mistake. The definition is located on its "Organization" page, which I in Reference 35. I added it immediately after Reference 119.</li></ul></li>
<li>114: OK. I wonder how you found this program though; did you systematically search every university website?
<ul><li>So the <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carillon&amp;oldid=1003191448">list of universities existed</a></span> before I began working on this article. I did not systematically search for all universities with a carillon for potential academic programs, but rather I tried to preserve the already present, unsourced information about specific American universities by adding sources. For Iowa State University, the concert program was the best I could do. If this is an unacceptable source, I can remove the university from the list.</li></ul></li>
<li>68: Can I have a copy of the page cited here? Also, I am not sure that the first link supports any of the claims.
<ul><li>Is the "first link" Thorne? I include the rape of Belgium because of this quote from Thorne: "<span style="color:green;">Bells were used in early-WW I propaganda to decry 'the rape of Belgium.'</span> "
<ul><li>Got the copy, it seems like it supports the claims otherwise. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 09:36, 18 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>102: Can I have a copy of the page cited here?
<dl><dd>Got it, it seems like it only supports part of the claims (it doesn't list the names, for instance) and some others have <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CLOP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CLOP">close paraphrase</a> problems. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 09:36, 18 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Are you talking about 102e, which supports the sentence "<span style="color:green;">Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum.</span>", and by names you mean names of the universities? The Rombouts source supports the general sentence, while each named university is supported by its own citation. I also addressed the paraphrasing.</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li>32: Can I have a copy of the page cited here?
<dl><dd>Got the copy, it doesn't seem to support the claim. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 09:36, 18 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Which claim? I assume you mean the sentence "<span style="color:green;">[The Riverside Church bourdon bell] sounds a full octave below most other bourdons.</span>" I realize that reference is placed poorly. It should be right before that sentence, as Ref 33 supports the claim. I moved it. <a href="/wiki/User:Thrakkx" title="User:Thrakkx">Thrakkx</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thrakkx" title="User talk:Thrakkx">talk</a>) 00:38, 20 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li>47: The source does not mention the 16th century, and at least one sentence was taken entirely from there.
<ul><li>You are right about 16th century: removed. Oops, removed the plagiarism. I checked all other Swager references and removed one instance of too-close paraphrasing.</li></ul></li>
<li>112: Hrm, doesn't this source merely say that the university <i>has</i> a carillon?
<ul><li>This page is a subpage of "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.clemson.edu/caah/departments/performing-arts/students/Music/Keyboard/index.html">Keyboard Studies</a>", which lists a faculty member as the director of the carillon and organ programs. The page the article currently links to also shows that auditions are required to participate in the carillon program. Would it be better to link to the Keyboard Studies page?</li>
<li>Without your input I chose to link to the Keyboard Studies page. <a href="/wiki/User:Thrakkx" title="User:Thrakkx">Thrakkx</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thrakkx" title="User talk:Thrakkx">talk</a>) 00:38, 20 August 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<li>8: This should probably say "Ng and Lewis" rather than just "Ng" as it seems like the script was written by more than one person. Also, it might help
<ul><li>I am not sure what you mean. Reference 8 says "Ng &amp; Lewis 2020, p. 1."
<ul><li>Means that since two people wrote the source, the article ought to mention both. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>) 17:55, 14 August 2021 (UTC)

<li>118: Why was this particular group selected for inclusion?
<ul><li>It is a registry sponsored by the University of Leuven, the Carnegie Foundation, and the City of The Hague, among others, which I feel makes it a great selection among the "themed" registries I could have chosen. For reference, every regional carillon organization counts the carillons in their region, so I had a handful of registries to choose from.</li></ul></li></ul>

<dl><dd>Hi <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo</a>, and thanks for going through this so diligently. I'll recuse and volunteer to give a second opinion. Without seeing the extent of the problem, I have some sympathy; it is a difficult balance to stay close enough to the source to be bullet proof, but far enough away to not run into copyright issues. I am assuming that there is not mass cut-and-pasting from sources - could you let me know if there is/has been. I am assuming that you will need to pass the source material you received on to me? Meanwhile, has the close paraphrasing which you identified above all been satisfactorily addressed?</dd>
<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Thrakkx" title="User:Thrakkx">Thrakkx</a>, could you have a look at the top four "compare"s on <a class="external text" href="https://copyvios.toolforge.org/?lang=en&amp;project=wikipedia&amp;title=Carillon&amp;oldid=&amp;action=search&amp;use_engine=1&amp;use_links=1&amp;turnitin=1">this Earwig report</a> and rephrase as far as you can any of the "free prose" (ie not titles of works, proper nouns etc) high lighted in red. It would be a good idea to skim through everything else and change anything which you think cleaves too closely to its source. I am assuming that by now you understand where the line should be drawn re paraphrasing - if you are unsure please let me know - and that you have gone through the article ensuring that all over-close paraphrsing has been removed or copy edited - again, if not, let me know. This is important as if my second opinion shows more than trivial amounts of over-close paraphrasing of free prose the nomination is liable to be archived. <a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Gog_the_Mild" title="User talk:Gog the Mild">talk</a>) 20:06, 2 September 2021 (UTC)

<ul><li>Second opinion. Most of the paraphrasing is good. Supported by the text, but neatly rephrased. I did note areas where this was not so. Eg " Price said he capitalized on" and "Price capitalized on ". Not a show stopper, and not too many like it, but perhaps a synonym for "capitalized"? That said, the article currently seems to be free of unduly close paraphrasing, and so, taking my findings together with <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo</a>'s comments above I am going to pass the spot check. <a href="/wiki/User:Gog_the_Mild" title="User:Gog the Mild">Gog the Mild</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Gog_the_Mild" title="User talk:Gog the Mild">talk</a>) 20:30, 8 September 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I personally believe that the first picture (carillonneur at a keyboard) is the best header image for the article, as it is difficult to distinguish a carillon from a <a href="/wiki/Chime_(bell_instrument)" title="Chime (bell instrument)">chime</a> or other bell instrument just by looking at the collection of bells.

<p>Some points noted in passing.
</p>
<ul><li>"brutal annihilation of a unique, democratic music instrument" - you have inserted punctuation not in the original.
<ul><li><b>Fixed.</b></li></ul></li>
<li>"brutal annihilation of a unique, democratic music instrument". The MoS on quotations: "[t]he source must be named <i>in article text</i> if the quotation is an opinion". Emphasis in original.
<ul><li>Are you saying that the sentence I am quoting should appear in the citation immediately following the quote, or that I should put in the running text that Thorne claims this to be true?
<ul><li>Something <i>like</i> 'The historian of music [or whatever] Stephen Thorn writes that the destruction of European carillons during World War I and World War II was seen by the Allied Powers as a "brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument".' I note that you <i>have</i> correctly attributed in line a quote by Ng in the Music section - something like that.
<ul><li><b>Added.</b></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>For "Unlike the organ or pedal piano, the carillon's pedals are shorter, thicker, and spaced far apart." you rely on Courter et al p. 2. I cannot find in this source any mention of organs or pianos. Could you help me out.
<ul><li>This is my mistake. After gaining access to the Lehr source a while back, I replaced a lot of text and citations. Seemed to have missed this one, which is really lackluster. I am going to simply remove this sentence, as the only mention in my preferred source on the comparison is "<span style="color:green;">As seen in Figure 69, the design of the carillon console is modeled after the organ or piano. The white keys, the diatonic notes, lie lower and are longer than the black keys, the chromatic notes. The rest of the console is not similar, except that the carillon console and the organ both have pedals.</span>"</li></ul></li>
<li>"the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90 percent are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80 percent of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions". Cite 131 does not cover the first (part) sentence. Have you slipped a cite?
<ul><li>Oh, yes. The first two sentences in that paragraph are a written summary of what you can learn from the table below. Same goes for the last sentence. <b>Added</b> the table citations to the text.</li></ul></li>
<li>"The reinvention initiated a revival of carillon building". I am not sure that "reinvention" is the best word.
<ul><li>What about "rediscovery", as they rediscovered how the Hemony brothers tuned bells?
<ul><li>Yep, that's a good way of phrasing it
<ul><li><b>Changed.</b></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>"The reinvention initiated a revival of carillon building". Could you quote the words in the Britannica article you are relying on to support this? Thanks.
<ul><li>Like the above, are you saying I should place the quote within the citation?
<ul><li>No, sorry, I am asking if you could help me out as a spot checker by quoting <i>here</i> what in the Britannica you are using to support that text.
<ul><li>I see. This is what I am using: "<span style="color:green;">The rediscovery of the tuning process at the John Taylor and Company foundry in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England, in the 1890s initiated a revival of carillon art.</span>" <i>Carillon art</i> is a common term in this field, which is incredibly general. People use it to refer to carillon music, carillon performance techniques, the population of carillons in a particular area, and in this case, the construction of new carillons.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Trisomy X is one of the more common genetic syndromes you probably haven't heard of. Affecting one in a thousand women, the highest estimates for how many know they have it are around 10%, and it goes down a lot from there. It helps that the presentation is so variable -- how often do people get their chromosomes tested when they have no symptoms at all? And yet, sometimes those 'no symptoms at all' are the result of an entire extra chromosome. Fantastic how the human body works.
</p><p>This is the main article of a series I've been working on extensively over the past few months. It's the first article I've taken to FAC; a previous article in the same series has gone through pre-FAC PR, which I've leaned on heavily while writing this to keep the article tight, accessible, and educational. I'm as happy with it as I can ever be with my own writing (you know how it is) and only <i>a little</i> crippled by self-doubt. I hope you find this an enjoyable and educational read on a sparsely-written topic, which I've gained the confidence to say is perhaps now the most comprehensive piece on the subject available to a general audience. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 02:36, 21 June 2021 (UTC)

<p>What an excellent article this is! I shall be doing a text review, enjoying all the while. My first suggestion is, in the lead:
</p><p><s>*"Beginning in the 1960s, cohort studies following people with sex chromosome aneuploidies from birth to adulthood found that people with these disorders are often mildly affected, fitting in with the general population, and that many cases never come to diagnostic attention."
</s></p><s><dl><dd>How about "...and that many cases never came to diagnostic attention." to keep the tenses consistent and also to avoid simply duplicating the last sentence of the first paragraph (i.e. this sentence is about the historical context, not specifically just about the disorder.)
<dl><dd>Tenses fixed. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 23:46, 21 June 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><ul><li>You blue link aneuploidy, but it's such a fundamental part of the article, I'd define it both in the summary and when it first appears. It was only when I got to the end of the article that I saw the definition was notated -- I'd put it in the text proper (ditto karyotype). Indeed, the problem with notes is they're essentially invisible -- they definitely shouldn't be used for fundamental definitions but rather (if at all -- I kind of hate notes in WP articles) for anecdotal asides not critical to the piece.
<dl><dd>This, I think, might be more in the realm of personal disagreement. One consideration I've used while writing that's similar to the mobile one (i.e. "most readers know this but most writers don't") is that logged-out editors have a gadget similar to navigation popups turned on by default -- assuming the leads for the given articles aren't terrible (that might be worth checking...) they can see the definitions of bluelinked terms simply by hovering without having to follow to the next article. I've used annotations because the definitions worth giving are somewhat long, and I worry it would distract from the text to give them in full. I recognize the concerns about notes bleeding into the references; I use &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:NoteTag" title="Template:NoteTag">NoteTag</a>&#125;&#125; for them to try minimize this, as it stands out a lot more than a more subtle marker does. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 23:46, 21 June 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></s><s><p><b>Presentation</b>

<ul><li>Aha, actually -- I mixed up which you were referring to in the first. The use in "Causes" is not (yet) unliked, on account of the 'separate section' issue; a mobile reader only opening "Causes" doesn't <i>know</i> we've just been through a discussion of mosaicism, and so risks having the term lost on them. I self-confess to overlinking even within my framework of "we should link jargon generously so readers looking at isolated sections can follow", so there may be an argument for omitting it, but there's a real risk many readers will be introduced to that section without being aware of what's before it. I did unlink the use at the beginning of "Mosaic forms", though, because any reader looking at that <i>is</i> about to get into a big discussion of them better than that article/its navigation popup would give. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 01:49, 28 June 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<ul><li>Added control numbers.

Also, what part of the preceding is it intended to support?  Because it seems to be referring to the Denver one and says that the program was cancelled shortly before the researcher died and implies funding was what ended it while the article suggests that it was the death
<ul><li>As regards both these points: they were both intended to tie more smoothly in with something I was absolutely <i>certain</i> I'd added to the society and culture section (sex chromsosome aneuploidies and abortion) and promptly found out I had not, which is now in there. The source you pick at is used for "what women with trisomy X think about the condition" purposes (which I think might be able to be expanded a little more -- will double-check some of the sociological studies), which as the section indeed mentions is more often in single-case informal descriptions than in widespread study, because there just isn't much written on the karyotype from a non-medical perspective. (It's also, to note a specific note, not self-published but rather vetted by a major trisomy X organization.) I've since cut the use of it for this statement, which I thought at first was interesting detail but on review is more extraneous detail. The blockquote I like -- it's a solid summary of "where the research is" presented in a way more understandable/relatable to general readers than the admittedly dense remainder of that section -- but I'm agnostic on precisely where it goes; there's a good argument for putting it in "Society and culture", where the abortion discussions it ties into are, and where the fact it's written from a sociological rather than medical perspective doesn't pose an issue. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 04:15, 29 June 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>" though the latter in particular is now discouraged" - is it worth saying why without becoming undue detail?
<ul><li>The source is a bit sparse on this, just recommending it without reason. <i>In context</i> it's rather clear that the reason is "because searching 'triple x women' on the internet isn't exactly going to put results on trisomy X front and centre", but taking this from the source is technically OR.

<p>I'm pleased to see another medicine article, and will happily do a source review. 
</p><p>Some of the reviews cited here are a bit older than we'd see at the typical medicine FA, but I'm guessing that's due to a paucity of existing sources. I'll take a look later this week, but if there's nothing more recent written in textbooks or journals I think we can safely assume those slightly older reviews still reliably represent medical knowledge.
</p><p>Currently checking uses of primary sources...
</p>
<ul><li>It seems a bit odd to cite "Several factors can affect... with other chromosomes are present" to a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24502039/">retrospective study of 36 people</a> in a niche journal (at least I think it's niche? I've never heard of it before but can't find much info on it...). Seems the same info could be cited to one of your more obviously reliable sources.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://academic.oup.com/ejo/article/27/4/396/416479">ref 10</a> is nicely contextualized.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://academic.oup.com/ejo/article/27/4/396/416479">ref 12</a> (increased enamel thickness and root length) is presumably not covered in other sources, and is contextualized as "... have all been connected to the condition", which seems fine to me.</li></ul>
<p>... stepping away from the computer, but will be working on this in jumps and starts over the next few days. Feel free to respond to any issues as I go, or to wait.

<dl><dd>Thank you, Ajpolino!&#160;:) You're pretty right on the source limitations here (I remember you being pretty shocked by the ones at the tetrasomy X PR, heh); the Unique guide updated this year still uses Tartaglia 2010 and Otter 2009, as well as a few much older than those, as its major sources, and I'm broadly not expecting anything big and new to be published on non-Klinefelter sex chromosome aneuploidies until the eXtraordinarY Babies studies get into swing, which is a decades-off matter. Will take another look at my use of ref 4; it's mostly an attempt to contextualize early in the article something that gets discussed in fuller depth later (including with better studies) without following it with a million citations. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 04:26, 4 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thanks for the ping. Finally got back to it today. All the other primary sources are explicitly called out as such in the text. The rest is to secondary sources. I won't pretend to know the field well enough to know each of the journals, but the ones cited here are from publishers with a reputation for running legitimate peer review operations. On the edge of that label are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/167002/article">ref 58</a> from <a href="/wiki/Bentham_Science_Publishers" title="Bentham Science Publishers">Bentham</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/4/947">ref 92</a> from <a href="/wiki/MDPI" title="MDPI">MDPI</a>. Each of those publishers has attracted some criticism for at-times uninspiring peer review. In general, I think their papers are fine to use with some added scrutiny. I'll leave you to look into it (and perhaps you already have) and decide if you trust each for the material you've sourced to them. I'll move on to verification spot-checks, which I believe is customary for first-time nominators (though now that I mention it I can't find that written anywhere...) <a href="/wiki/User:Ajpolino" title="User:Ajpolino">Ajpolino</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ajpolino" title="User talk:Ajpolino">talk</a>) 00:16, 12 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I recall the custom being written too -- at any rate, thank you! Regarding the more borderline cases, I've had my eye on the Bentham source for a while and have been seriously considering switching it out, which I'll probably do. MDPI is...one I'd probably drop in a more mainstream context, but animal cytogenetics is not a sexy field and it's really a miracle we have a literature review from 2021 on the matter. If it were supporting a different part of the article I'd be looking for a better publisher, but "flawed-but-not-actively-predatory publisher for a very niche matter" is one where I think the rest of it works out to acceptable. The authors are also published on similar topics in better journals, which helps. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 00:54, 12 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

The way it's written it appears as if this ref is for the end of the sentence, but I don't see either of the facts in that half of the sentence -- trisomy X patients mostly have partial seizures (if they have seizures) and that epilepsy/EEG abnormalities are more common in those with intellectual disability -- in the ref. Perhaps in Roubertie, et al. (currently ref 32) next to it? But I don't have access to that journal.
<ul><li>The focus on intellectual disability is in ref 32, yes (I leaned towards ending the sentence with both because I don't like cutting up with refs <i>too</i> much, and both focus on the partial-seizures part); if you can't access the full text, it's mentioned in the abstract (<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Although a specific electro-clinical pattern could not be defined, the epileptic phenotypes of these patients share many features; we suggest that the association 47,XXX/epilepsy/mental retardation may not be coincidental</q>). Partial seizures do come up in ref 3 (<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Medical history should include questions regarding staring spells or atypical movements, since seizure disorders and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities can be present in females with trisomy X and may present as partial or absence seizures. In these cases, EEG studies should be performed to rule out possible seizure activity</q>). <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 05:22, 12 July 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Not to split hairs, but I think either the text or the referencing (or my brain) is still unclear: "... and may present as partial or absence seizures." (source) vs "epilepsy or EEG abnormalities, particularly partial seizures..." (our article) are not getting across the same thing. <a href="/wiki/User:Ajpolino" title="User:Ajpolino">Ajpolino</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ajpolino" title="User talk:Ajpolino">talk</a>) 16:47, 17 July 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>This is one that does trip me up a bit. Source #3 discusses absence seizures, but I have <i>no clue</i> where it's getting that from, because more or less everything else (including the primary sources in it) overwhelmingly focus on partial seizures, and the other sources supplementing that one inline only discuss partial seizures. I think the balance of the evidence works out to focusing on partial seizures gives readers a more accurate impression of the literature. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 17:22, 19 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>[p] (first par. of mosaic forms section)- not a big deal, but our current text implies that 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX mosaicism is less common than the other mosaics. Best I can tell, the source doesn't make that distinction. Does some other source explicitly distinguish them as less common? I get that the triple mosaic genotype is <i>probably</i> less common than the doubles, but if none of the reviews explicitly comment on it, perhaps we're better rephrasing to avoid the implication?
<ul><li>If not less common, than at least less core, if that makes sense. It's a hard thing to dredge up explicitly-less-common sources for, as searches are pretty thrown off by complex mosaicism in autosomes and double-trisomies (e.g. 48,XXX+21 karyotypes). I've found a couple things explicitly calling it less common, but they're primary and often preprints. The wording here is a bit evasive/general, so there might be a direction it can be tweaked in to get the idea across even if those sources wind up unusable? <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 15:01, 12 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>[q] (The 46,XX/47,XXX subsection) - would you mind being more precise with the reference placement in this paragraph? It's a bit of a verification challenge. All this source says on the topic is that 46,XX/47,XXX happens, and that outcomes are better than 47,XXX.</li>
<li>[r] ("Between 3% and 15%... have a 47,XXX cell line") - Just a note this source says 5-15%, the other source's (Lim, et al. 2017) discussion says 3-4% so I'm assuming this is your compromise? Disagreeing numbers is a perennial trick for writing medicine articles, so I feel your pain. Just flagging this in case it's a typo and you meant to go with the 5-15% range. It's odd the sources have such a broad disagreement, but what're you gonna do.
<ul><li>It's a compromise, yeah. I might tweak it lower -- more sources lean towards the lower numbers than the higher ones -- but I'm not totally confident on that yet (only just beginning a <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Vaticidalprophet/Turner_syndrome&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Vaticidalprophet/Turner syndrome (page does not exist)">rewrite</a> of <a href="/wiki/Turner_syndrome" title="Turner syndrome">Turner syndrome</a>) and so it's pending further reading in Turner-focused sources, because they disagree with each other here too. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 05:22, 12 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>[u] ("Nondisjunction is related to... average maternal age was 33.") - I don't see the part about the cohort of women born in the '60s.
<ul><li>Huh, you're right -- I've <i>certainly</i> read this somewhere, but apparently not here. I suspect I might've been moving around refs at a prior point and accidentally cut where I got that from. Have cut the second line for now, pending its verification. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 05:22, 12 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>[w] ("As trisomy X generally has... routinely performed for advanced maternal age.") - I don't see the bit about routine testing with advanced maternal age. But perhaps I just missed it? Hard to guess what section it would be in.
<ul><li>The routine testing here is that amniocentesis/CVS are routinely performed for pregnant women in that age range, and trisomy X is picked up on those tests; the tests are brought up a few times (e.g. <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Diagnosis during the prenatal period by amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling is common</q>). Should "these are tests used in advanced maternal age" be cited somewhere else? It's a bit sky-is-blue within the field, so it isn't explicitly mentioned in literature at this level, but it'll probably be in patient-targeted stuff I can find relatively easy -- those things just won't tend to mention trisomy X specifically. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 05:22, 12 July 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>Ah I see. I think it's fine as sky-is-blue material then. <a href="/wiki/User:Ajpolino" title="User:Ajpolino">Ajpolino</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ajpolino" title="User talk:Ajpolino">talk</a>) 16:47, 17 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>4 (Butnariu, et al. 2013) - What a coincidence! This is one I flagged earlier. My opinion is that this should be replaced by a more reliable source. The claim it sources is basically that mosaicism can affect the trisomy X phenotype. Should be able to find that elsewhere.
<ul><li>Have moved ref 3 up to replace this, as it mentions it as well. <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 05:22, 12 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<li>5 (Otter, et al. 2009) - [a-f, h, i, k, m-q] all check out. Notes on the others:
<ul><li>[g] "A minority[ref] of patients have epilepsy or EEG abnormalities..." - I'm confused as to what this is referencing. The source says "EEG abnormalities seem to be rather common" and doesn't give a sense of epilepsy prevalence. Could you clarify?
<ul><li>Have changed to 'a subset' and moved the ref around. I <i>think</i> the wording of this source is fairly intended to be read that epilepsy specifically is a minority thing, though (e.g. mentioning its relatively low prevalence in newborn screening samples). <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 19:05, 16 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>[j] "behavioral issues in children with trisomy X... emotional maturity encouraging hard-to-reach expectations." - Could you clarify the source text this is based on?
<ul><li><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">It seemed that the physical phenotype (being the tallest but immature and somewhat clumsy girl in the peer group, sometimes with precocious puberty) and the behavioural phenotype (speech and language disorders, sensory-integration disorders and academic difficulties) could explain some social problems.</q> <a href="/wiki/User:Vaticidalprophet" title="User:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:black">Vaticidal</b></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Vaticidalprophet" title="User talk:Vaticidalprophet"><b style="color:#66023C">prophet</b></a> 19:05, 16 July 2021 (UTC)
<ul><li>I could be missing obvious subtext here, but I read the source text to simply mean that being physically and behaviorally distinct from your peers makes social life difficult. The article text describes a more complex situation. <a href="/wiki/User:Ajpolino" title="User:Ajpolino">Ajpolino</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ajpolino" title="User talk:Ajpolino">talk</a>) 16:47, 17 July 2021 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>[l] could you quote the source text for "Adult employment is generally in lower-skill pink-collar occupations"? It also cites <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19990416)88:2%3C200::AID-AJMG18%3E3.0.CO;2-3">Bender, et al. 2002</a> but I don't seem to have access to that. The only thing I see in this source is "The 47,XXX women most often find jobs that reflect their performance abilities." but maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.
<ul><li>Lower-skill employment comes up several times (<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">They planned to take jobs requiring low academic and linguistic skills</q>; <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">These girls found unskilled labour after leaving school</q>).

<li>21 Stagi, et al. 2016 - Checks out. Any reason to mention LH but not FSH?

<li>23 Cordts, et al. 2011 - [a&amp;b] both look good.</li>
<li>28 Black, et al. 2015 - I'm not sure where the 3% floor came from (maybe the other source?) but I trust your judgment here. This is always a hard kind of thing to cite.</li>
<li>30 Grosso, et al. 2004 - Good.</li>
<li>33 Maenner, et al. 2020 - Good.</li>
<li>41 Neri and Opitz 1984 - I assume this is just to cite "Some writers have recommended... during pregancy"? If so, checks out.</li>
<li>53 Graves, et al. 2009 - Good.</li>
<li>55 O'Connor 2008 - Sure.</li>
<li>57 Meazza, et al. 2017 - [a&amp;b] good</li>
<li>59 Otteson, et al. 2010 - I'm not really sure what this is verifying. It seems like the two preceding sentences "Pentasomy X, with... and short stature." are backed up by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/trisomy-x/">rarediseases.org</a> source. Otteson et al only addresses the relationship between height and chrom. X copies.
<ul><li>That's valid, I must have brain-farted about whether the height thing was in the other source.

<li>65 Berglund, et al. 2019 - [a, b] Good.</li>
<li>77 Tartaglia, et al. 2020 - Good.</li>
<li>91 O'Connor, et al. 2011 - basically good, but pardon the quibble: maybe "trisomy X is strongly linked to infertility" is worded just a bit strong? The source says "In dogs, the few reports of trisomy X in the current literature had... either primary anestrus or infertility...".</li>
<li>94 Prakash, et al. 1994 - I can't seem to access this one. The title just about says it all, so I'll trust your judgment on this one.</li></ul>
<p>Alright, all done. Thanks for your quick responses, and apologies for my extreme slowness. I've got a couple of outstanding quibbles that you're welcome to consider.

<ul><li>As regards the "should this be at the thing the article is titled at" comments in general: I think, per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTBROKEN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTBROKEN">WP:NOTBROKEN</a>, they shouldn't be. Everything I've used is a valid and frequent term for the relevant anatomy, disorder, etc. NOTBROKEN explicitly <i>opposes</i> changing redirects from valid alternative terms, because it obscures how often those terms are used onwiki and accordingly whether they would make for better article titles than the current one.

<p>I have some reservations. The  article seems to be written for clinicians because there are expressions like "clinical portrait", "<i>frank</i> microcephaly", "one study..", "with the condition", "a literature review found", and – the dreadful – "control women"! I am also concerned about the number of primary studies cited, which goes against <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MEDRS">WP:MEDRS</a>. Are they all adding value?

<p>I did a source review, but GB's comment above piqued my interest in looking at the prose as well. I'm no prose wizard, but below are some suggestions for de-clinicalizing and improving the flow of text. Take them or leave them. Also I'd suggest a quick read (or re-read) of <a href="/wiki/User:Tony1/How_to_improve_your_writing#Eliminating_redundancy" title="User:Tony1/How to improve your writing">User:Tony1/How_to_improve_your_writing#Eliminating_redundancy</a>, which I continue to find helpful for me:

<ul><li>"Trisomy X has a variable phenotype, ranging from <s>cases with</s> no symptoms at all to <s>relatively</s> significant disability<s>, and the clinical portrait is not entirely clear</s>"</li>
<li>"Nonetheless, a number of... in the medical literature" - you don't need to state the obvious "in the medical literature", can you rephrase to something like "People with trisomy X have some consistent... traits?". The reader assumes you're deriving them from the medical literature.</li>
<li>"Severity is known to vary..." &gt; "Severity varies"</li>
<li>"most of which are <s>quite</s> subtle"</li>

<li>"The height excess" &gt; "The added height" (they don't really have an <i>excess</i> of height. They're just a bit taller)</li>
<li>"<s>frank</s> microcephaly" (as GB points out above)</li>
<li>"Severe internal disease is rare in trisomy X; although heart defects..." &gt; "rare in trisomy X. Although heart defects..." - At first read I thought the "although" was to contrast with the previous sentence, rather than the subsequent clause. Momentarily confusing.</li>
<li>I think there's a typo in "The study of mental health... by those diagnosed after." Maybe "by" &gt; "than"?</li>
<li>I'd cut "in one exceptional case... including a daughter with Turner syndrome." <a href="/wiki/Hard_cases_make_bad_law" title="Hard cases make bad law">Exceptional cases</a> make for odd articles.</li></ul></li>
<li>Causes
<ul><li>"with around 90% of cases <s>being</s> traced..."</li>
<li>"Mosaic trisomy X is associated with a higher rate of offspring with chromosomal disorders" - I'd cut this. You just told us the same a few paragraphs above.</li></ul></li>
<li>Diagnosis
<ul><li>"As trisomy X generally has a mild or asymptomatic phenotype,..." &gt; "As trisomy X is generally mild or asymptomatic..."</li>
<li>"It is estimated that" can be removed (though you'll need a bit of downstream rewording).</li>
<li>"Indications for postnatal testing for trisomy X include..." &gt; "Postnatal testing is typically promted by..." or something like that.</li>
<li>"As postnatal karyotyping generally occurs... a more severe phenotype than prenatal" - I'd cut this sentence too. It's an important fact, but you've mentioned it several times by this point in the article.</li>
<li>"Cases of trisomy X with more severe... a particular differential diagnosis of trisomy X" - I think you could cut these two sentences and instead open this paragraph with something like "Severe cases of trisomy X can appear similar to tetrasomy X".</li>
<li>"karyotype alone explains, such as <s>in the setting of</s> severe intellectual disability..."</li>
<li>"A literature review found that..." seems like it could be cut?</li></ul></li>
<li>Epidemiology
<ul><li>"Trisomy X's severe underdiagnosis... severe than the general 47,XXX population." - I'd cut this sentence. Again, you've mentioned it a few times this point, and the paragraph is clear without it.</li></ul></li>
<li>History
<ul><li>"served to dispel" &gt; "dispelled" (and then you'll have to change "reveal" to "revealed" a few words downstream)</li>
<li>It's not clear to me if/why the 2007 "study day" merits mention in the history section. Are study days a thing? Google suggests it's just a daylong meeting. Do we know if anything in particular came out of it? If so, perhaps you could briefly highlight that.</li>
<li>"...Babies Study, a planned <s>new</s> cohort study..."</li>
<li>"... though the latter <s>in particular</s> is now discouraged."</li></ul></li>
<li>In other animals
<ul><li>I'm not clear on the relevance of the brief discussion of the canine pseudoautosomal region. If it's not relevant to trisomy X, you can probably cut it. If it is, maybe you could tweak the wording to clarify?</li>
<li>"... found to have trisomy X was found<s>, on investigation,</s> to have..."</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Made a first pass through. I think prose improvements are very achievable. If there's any other way I can help feel free to ping me.

<p>I'm concerned about some of the sources used in the 'Society and culture' section. What makes <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.triple-x-syndroom.nl/katie">[41]</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.triple-x-syndroom.nl/christine">[42]</a> high-quality reliable sources? They seem to be self-published personal reflections and I don't think we can make claims such as "Women with trisomy X and their families have criticised these abortions" and "Women with trisomy X discussing their experiences express optimism about the karyotype and hope for other people with it" based on the personal opinions of two people. These sources <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/features/an-extraordinary-clinic/index.html">[43]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://emorynursingmagazine.emory.edu/issues/2018/winter/features/hiding-plain-sight/index.html">[44]</a> seem to have been published by Emory to promote their own sex chromosome disorders clinic - not seeing how these are high-quality RS? <a href="/wiki/User:Spicy" title="User:Spicy">Spicy</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Spicy" title="User talk:Spicy">talk</a>) 10:05, 6 August 2021 (UTC)

<p>I found the proper footnote for "...maternal age 33" and reintroduced the sentence.

<p>Vaticidalprophet has worked diligently and admirably on this article for quite some time, and has not gotten the attention deserved from several of us medical editors, who have been impacted by other issues at other FAs.  I hope this can be brought over the line, specifically with respect to the primary source list on the talk page, possible attention to page numbers in sporadic instances of long articles, wrt the original research on speech therapy I mentioned above in the HF section, wrt consistent citation formatting (eg, remove uppercase on journal titles for consistency), and I am not a fan of a quote from a lesser quality source that begins with “Our doctor told us”.  That kind of source might be used to source Societal and cultural aspects, but not medical info.  The article still needs some attention to sourcing— work which I see is undergoing on article talk.  If that work is completed, I also see other areas where language/jargon might need attention; for example, the introduction of karotype in the first sentence is jargony.  Kudos to Vaticidal for bringing this article to such a high state, and I hope it can be brought over the FA line.  I apologize for my lack of help; the Wikipedia FA muse left me after a recent socking issue. <a href="/wiki/User:SandyGeorgia" title="User:SandyGeorgia"><b>Sandy</b><span style="color: green;">Georgia</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>)  22:34, 4 September 2021 (UTC)
