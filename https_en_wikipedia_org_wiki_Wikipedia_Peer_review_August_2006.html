<p>I've done a lot of work on this article over the past few weeks, taking it from a monolithic 80KB <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Philippines&amp;oldid=61343149">[1]</a>, spliting it into 6 sub-articles by time period, and practically rewriting the main article into a relatively lean 37KB. I'd like this peer review to just focus on the main <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines" title="History of the Philippines">History of the Philippines</a> article, and what it needs to meet FA criteria. If this peer review turns out nicely I would really like to take the article all the way to FA status.&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/User:TheCoffee" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 06:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>A quick skim revealed a couple of problems from my perspective:
<ol><li>There are duplicate links to the same article. Cebu, for example, and both Spain and Spanish link to Spain in the same paragraph. There are many more examples. The style guide prefers linking only once, typically the first appearance in the article.</li>
<li>New Spain is noted as Mexico the second time it appears; shouldn't the note be with the first occurance? And this is another example of duplicate linking.</li>
<li>Can you put at least an introductory paragraph at the beginning of "American colonial period (1898-1946)" so that the first subcategory, "Philippine-American War" doesn't follow immediately? It flows better that way.</li>
<li>I prefer the end sections of See also / Notes / References / Further reading / External links, which is consistent with most articles. Most of your "General references" appear to be external links and none seem to be cited in the notes section, so perhaps it more accurately a "Further reading" section. Using another encyclopedia for a reference doesn't seem optimal to me; I would prefer to see a stronger source. I'm not sure how FAC reviewers will respond to these end section issues.</li></ol></dd>

<dl><dd>Thank you very much for the comments. I've fixed points #1, 2 and 3 that you mentioned. As for #4... all of those links were used as references, and I'm working on converting all of them to footnotes so perhaps the "General references" part could later be done away with. <a href="/wiki/User:TheCoffee" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 16:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Summary of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Automated" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Automated">automated suggestions</a>: <b>(1)</b> Wikilink dates, <b>(2)</b> headings don't start with "The", <b>(3)</b> weasel words, <b>(4)</b> watch for redundancies, and <b>(5)</b> copyedit. I've taken care of #1 and #2. All the obvious weasel words have citations (and if any others remain, I'd appreciate someone pointing them out). As for #4 and #5... I've looked over the article many times, so I guess I've done what I can do. <a href="/wiki/User:TheCoffee" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 16:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I read through the article. There are only few points which I could come up with.
</p>
<ul><li>In the lead - "The Indian observatory however, is located in the town..." - I could not make out which Indian observatory is being talked about. A wikilink would help.</li>
<li>In the history section - "Bombay time was maintained until 1955". But the very next sentence says that the Indian government established IST as the official time in 1947. So does that mean that Bombay did not follow IST for 8 years after independence?</li>
<li>In the Problems section - Who were the researchers in 1980? Independent or government? What happened to the suggestion made by them?</li>
<li>In the Time signals section - ATA is linked to a disambiguation page.</li></ul>
<p>That's all I could come up with. This is my first comment at a peer review of an article. Hope some of the points raised by me are valid. - <a href="/wiki/User:Aksi_great" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aksi_great" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_Review/Aksi_great" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 18:37, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
</p><p>Thanks for your review. Yes, the points are perfectly valid. I'll reply to each:
</p>
<ul><li>Indian observatory &#8211; I'm still to get credible data on this... will try and fix soon</li>
<li>Yes, Bombay did not use IST till 1955. I'll try and word it better.</li>
<li>Unfortunately my source <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1501252.stm">[2]</a> does not mention who the researchers were. Nothing concrete emerged out of it, and I've added it to the text. Thanks!</li>
<li>ATA is a call sign, I've remove the wikilink.</li></ul>

<p>Hello, This article was given a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Toledo_War/archive1" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Toledo War/archive1">peer review</a> about two months ago, GA status, and based on suggestions, was submitted to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Toledo_War" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Toledo War">FAC</a>, where it failed in early June. The main objection at that time was that the article was poorly written, and needed more copy-editing. Since then, I have put in a lot of effort, and the article has been added to, revised, and copy-edited. The goal is another (this time hopefully successful) FAC, and I was just wondering if you had any suggestions or comments about making this article better. I look forward to addressing your concerns, and thanks for all of your help! <a href="/wiki/User:Hotstreets" title="User:Hotstreets">Hotstreets</a> 04:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I don't think there's a lot to suggest to you except wow, this article is great. The fact that two of our states had a war amuses me greatly and the article just gets funnier as it goes on.  I did change two sentences that I thought could be better.  The first in the lead I was worried that people would think the federal and state government had argued as those were the two governments listed in the preceeding sentence.  The only thing that bothered me was that one paragraph in the 'Prelude to Conflict' section lacks any citations at all.  That seems like it should be easy to fix.  Again, I can't wait to see this article on the main page. It's a great article.--<a href="/wiki/User:Dekkanar" title="User:Dekkanar">Dekkanar</a> 00:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I edit a lot of articles for prose and this is one of the best I've found. Well done! Here are a few minor thoughts I had:
</p>
<ul><li>"U.S. state" Unabbreviated that's United States state and sounds redundant but maybe this is used commonly? I'm not sure.</li>
<li>There are some one sentence paragraphs like "Ohio would thus be granted access to the entire western Lake Erie shoreline, and the other new states would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.[4]" that could probably be integrated.</li>
<li>The state legislature would eventually name the county in which Toledo sat, Lucas County" When did this happen? I'm confused by its placement in the timeline and the words "would eventually"</li>
<li>"notoriously hot-headed Mason" need a cite for this subjective descriptions</li>
<li>"The line is identified on USGS topographical maps as the <i>South [Boundary] Michigan Survey</i>, and on Lucas County and Fulton County, Ohio road maps as "Old State Line Road."" Why is one italicized and one in quotes?</li></ul>
<p>I've made many quite minor edits to the article, often eliminating what appeared to be slight redundancies. I apologize if I removed anything necessary. Let me know when this is up for FAC and I'll definitely give it my support.

</p>
<dl><dd>Thank you very much for the feedback. I have worked on each of your points, but on a few I just wanted to explain below:
<dl><dd>- I left "U.S. state" as it is, due to the redundancy issues as well as the fact that the article that it links to is formally titled "U.S. state". I do agree that is it strange, though.</dd>
<dd>- The one sentence paragraph you mentioned was actually the result of the Wikisource boxes: it inadvertently broke the paragraph apart. I have fixed the problem so it no longer does that.</dd>
<dd>- I played with the paragraph regarding Lucas County, and I think I have improved it a bit. Unfortunately, that sentence provided the introduction to Governor Lucas in the prose, so moving it around proved awkward. Please let me know what you think of this; I did try to clarify the timeline as best as possible.</dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd>I have to disagree with you on the amount of information available. There is so much published on this species you would think it was Australia's only endangered species! The normal sections of taxonomy, physical description and distribution are good content wise (though need a serious copy-edit and lots of citations). The Conservation status is the one I am worried about. Although management is mentioned, it needs further elaboration. Salinity, and its effects on both chytrid and the frog are not mentioned, and the use of saline ponds to help conserve the species. Also, there is a lot of information on their ecology and behaviour. I read an article recently about their preferred winter habitat, which should be included. It also seems to be missing some other things, but I can't pin down what; I will get back to you on that. I will try and copyedit this, but I am currently working on quite a few articles, and may not get the time. One thing which is throughout the article which is annoying me. Try to use "The Green and Golden Bell Frog" at the start of paragraphs instead of "This species". Thanks --<a href="/wiki/User:LiquidGhoul" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 00:35, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The similar species paragraph is just a description of where this species fits into the complex - which is exacly the sort of thing that should go in the taxonomy section of an article, it doesn't need to be a subsection in the taxonomy.--<a href="/wiki/User:Petaholmes" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 13:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm trying to get this good article status and maybe eventually FA status.  I've put in a good deal of work into this including finding a bunch of references.

<li>Thanks for the automated notes - the technical stuff especially about headings and stuff is useful.  I'll make those changes later today.  If anyone would like to help out with removing "redundancies" and copyediting in general would be great, as I think it needs a second set of of eyes.  If anyone would like to expand on the automated stuff regarding "how to satisfy 2a" that'd be great, too!  Also, if anyone can judge how "complete" the article is, that'd be cool as I'm concerned about people's perspectives who don't really know anything about Sasha or electronic music in general.  <a href="/wiki/User:Wickethewok" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:44, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, taking a shot based on my limited knowledge of the subject...
<ul><li>One aspect where this article has exceled so far, I think, is presenting information in context. Explaining the artists' influence and stature in their musical fields is something that's not always easy to do, so good job on that. One thing, though — I seem to recall some criticism about the musical direction he's taken more recently, particularly post-Digweed. Any substance to that? Worth discussing?
<ul><li>Yeah, I agree.  Pretty much all of the reviews and such I seem to find don't really have an criticisms of Sasha.  I realize that some fans don't like the direction he has gone musically, but I haven't found any reliable sources discussing this (yet).  If you find any discussing criticism, I'd love to integrate them into the article.  I will continue looking myself as well.  Thanks for all the feedback btw, its much appreciated!  <a href="/wiki/User:Wickethewok" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul><li>I couldn't really think of any obvious major sources. Actually, I get the feeling sometimes that public opinion like this, particularly regarding dance music, is all just concentrated in forums — it can't really be pinned down to a solid, reliable source, which is what worries me.</li>
<li>Thought of another topic — the Allmusic review of GU013 kind of puts things into perspective regarding Sasha's place in the "rise and fall of trance music", so to speak. The first half of that has somewhat fallen out of public memory, while the second half of that I don't think many people are even aware of. Might be worth expanding. –<a href="/wiki/User:Unint" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 22:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>I would suggest sorting the discography by release types, as seems to be the widespread practice. Also, maybe awards could be sorted by won/nominated rather than using bold, though I wouldn't know where to find a specific citation on that; this is mainly based on the policy discouraging people from bolding #1 chart positions. –<a href="/wiki/User:Unint" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 21:08, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul><li>I fixed the discogs as you suggested.  I'm not quite sure how to format the awards section as I think sorting by won/nominated might look a little awkward (unless anyone can find a good example of how to do this).  I think I might change the "Awards" section into prose instead of a list.  Do you think thats a good idea?  <a href="/wiki/User:Wickethewok" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul><li>I looked at featured articles on films for ideas. The trend seems to be that major, award-heavy subjects get awards sections, while lesser-known subjects list awards with prose in a section like "Reception" or "Influence". (Of course, the significance of the award itself is going to be factor here.) Make what you will of that. –<a href="/wiki/User:Unint" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 22:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Thanks for the feedback, Unint.  When I get a chance I'll add the Allmusic review stuff in and write the awards section in prose.  Thanks for the feedback!  <a href="/wiki/User:Wickethewok" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 02:50, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>I have recently been rewriting this and many othe UK PC mag articles - as well as the list of PC magazines and have created the PC Magazines template. I am basically trying to improve them to a levle where thay can be featured content.
</p><p>Basically this article is still very much in development and has much more content to be added, plus of course wiki links need adding to this new version. In this context the article is very incomplete.
</p><p>What I am looking for is guidance and ideas on the format and layout of the article. Unfortunately many magazine articles on wikipedia are not very good and there isn't much in the way of a general layout. Which is a shame. So any ideas of how I can lay this article out / improve / add to it will be much much appreciated

</p><p>A few suggestions:
</p>
<ul><li>There is currently no <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEAD">lead</a> section - the article launches straight into what would usually be included in the main body of the article.</li>
<li>Avoid opinion based statements, such as "unfortunately a lack of response has made this section very intermittent", as this expresses a particular <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">point of view</a>.</li>
<li>The article currently lacks references or citations, other than forum postings, which are not generally viewed as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable sources</a>. Existing references should be converted to use the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite" class="extiw" title="m:Cite">m:Cite</a> format. It is not necessary to include Dennis Publishing's website inline - the wikilink to <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Publishing_Ltd." class="mw-redirect" title="Dennis Publishing Ltd.">Dennis Publishing Ltd.</a> is sufficient.</li>
<li>The article is biased towards the present - Micro Mart was very different 5 or 6 years ago, never mind 15 or 20 years ago. IIRC it was very much an <a href="/wiki/Auto_Trader" class="mw-disambig" title="Auto Trader">Auto Trader</a> type publication. The development of the magazine format - and the way that it was (and still is) bought for its advertising content by many people - should be covered in more depth.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Hi, Skully. I hate to mention it, but <a href="/wiki/Frank_Williams_Racing_Cars" title="Frank Williams Racing Cars">Frank Williams Racing Cars</a> is a totally different team to Williams F1 - they shouldn't be part of the same article (IMHO, of course!).

<ul><li>One other thing that worries me with the constructor articles - for the teams with a long history at least - is that it can read like "just one damn thing after another" to misquote someone or other on history. One approach that may work is to split out the article into more sections, as I am trying to do with <a href="/wiki/Brabham" title="Brabham">Brabham</a>, so different kinds of topics, like technical innovation (a good category for Williams!), notable drivers etc form separate sections.

<p>I wrote this article using German sources. Most of the things listed here are more or less considered accepted fact in German history, and therefore not particularly worthy of citations. I tried, however, to cite a couple of things I thought might be curiosities.

<ul><li>What is there is fine, but it seems like it could have more context earlier in the article. The lead paragraph / section could be longer and needs to summarize the article better. It does not specifically say Henry IV was the Holy Roman Emperor, and makes no mention of the Pope(!), whom Henry walked to Canosa to see. It might also help to give the length of the journey and locate it better (a map? more description of where Canossa and Augsburg etc. are?). Where did Henry start from? If someone does not already know a lot about the topic, the article could be confusing at first read. Not everyone knows what investiture is or why excommunication was such a dreaded outcome at the time and explaining these succinctly might make everything clearer and explain why Henry did what he did. I liked the section on Canossa in German culture especially. Hope this helps, <a href="/wiki/User:Ruhrfisch" title="User:Ruhrfisch">Ruhrfisch</a> 01:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I would appreciate a peer review of this article. Specifically:
</p>
<ol><li>Where are references most needed?</li>
<li>Where is the fluff, and can it be cut? This applies especially to the politics, education, and culture sections (where us New Englanders can be a bit too proud, I'm afraid).</li>
<li>What statements need references? Of course all claims should be cited. But which ones stick out as being especially in need of citation?</li>
<li>How's the grammar and writing style?</li>
<li>Should we keep the infobox, or get rid of it?</li>
<li>How's the length?</li>
<li><b>Most important:</b> What is currently preventing this article from achieving featured status, in your opinion?</li></ol>
<p>Any help with the following would be great:

<ul><li>The section <a href="/wiki/New_England#Notable_New_Englanders" title="New England">Notable New Englanders</a> has no entries, but only a link to the main article. How would you feel about adding a few really significant people, like U.S.  presidents?

<ul><li>The sports section is strong. Would mentioning minor-league teams strengthen it further? As it stands, it's top-heavy with Massachusetts teams. Also, Boston has a reputation for sports writing. Present and former reporters for the papers, and perhaps announcers, especially any who became famous nationwide, would be a possible direction for expanding the section. 07:10, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>There are also individual sports such as boxing, golf, tennis. Rocky Marciano and Marvin Hagler come to mind, and lists in articles on states would probably turn up more. Again, limiting the discussion to people who have won nationwide titles can help prevent it from growing out of hand. This is important because there are lots of individuals in sports (though few minor-league teams).  07:26, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Education section begins with a long list of colleges and universities. The following Culture and education section repeats much of the earlier section. Then Academic publishing contains just one paragraph. I suggest consolidating all three heads and rewriting to eliminate repetition.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Later, Urban New England contains two lists, which are not both necessary. The first is for Greater Boston, and belongs in the article <a href="/wiki/Greater_Boston" title="Greater Boston">Greater Boston</a>. The second is the one to keep for New England.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The two paragraphs on the Patriots' proposed move to Connecticut can probably be replaced by a single-sentence summary. There's similar material in the article on the Patriots.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In the Economy section you mention dairy production. This might be an opportunity to name Ben &amp; Jerry's, a brand with widespread recognition. Also to name the crops that farmers produce, including tobacco (Connecticut ranks 7th, which might surprise many readers). Potatoes, Christmas trees.

<ul><li>A few points.
<ul><li>The line <i>Some cultures fish for the oceanic whitetip shark as a delicacy or for its fin.</i> suggests that the oceanic white tip is specifically hunted, in fact just about every shark is. It could be clearer.</li>
<li>The line <i>the most common shark in its range, and perhaps the most abundant large animal in the world.</i> is somewhat at odds with it's vulnerable status - care to cite where it came from?
<ul><li>I was worried about that too, I think it comes from a 1969 publication by Lineaweaver and Backus but I haven't been able to track it down further yet. If it is from there it's obviously 37 years out of date (eek) <a href="/wiki/User:Yomangani" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 18:12, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>There is no information in the article about it's conservation status - given that the taxobox identifies it as vulnerable there probably is some information out theer about its threats (the fishing trade) and its prognosis. Like many pelagic sharks it may have declined masively (some species by as much as 95%) and this is important info to include. Information on it's popluations should be possible to find on Google Scholar <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Carcharhinus%20longimanus%20ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=scholart">[3]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Carcharhinus+longimanus+population&amp;btnG=Search">[4]</a>. The IUCN report says <i>This formerly widespread and abundant large oceanic shark is subject to fishing pressure virtually throughout its range.</i> It adds that for the North Atlantic it is <i>the oceanic whitetip shark is assessed as Critically Endangered in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic because of the enormous declines that have been reported.</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/39374/all">[5]</a></li>
<li><i>C. longimanus has a 'typical', although somewhat flattened shark body</i>. Typical for a requiem shark, perhaps?</li>
<li>Oceanic whitetips are a draw for divers - so perhaps a mention in the human section regarding their value for tourism?</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>It's heading in the right direction.

<p>Hi, any suggestions that could get this to FA level would be much appreciated. Thanks. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Versitywater&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Versitywater (page does not exist)">Versitywater</a> 00:49, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Ok, then:</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Cast. It's no good. It just won't do. See <a href="/wiki/Richard_III_(1955_film)" title="Richard III (1955 film)">Richard III (1955 film)</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca (film)</a> for ideas on how to make it not suck.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Trivia. FA no likey Trivia. Intergrate the most interesting and important parts of the Trivia section into the body of the article, and to hell with the rest.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Plot. Intergrate the sub-plot section into the the main plot. If every film article had a seperate section for each sub-plot, well, the <a href="/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Sith" class="mw-redirect" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a> article would be a mess.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Trailers and TV spots. Don't list and provide links to every single goddamned one. Just write a summary about "Promotion" or "Release". Get rid of this section</li></ul>
<ul><li>Connections to SII. Prosify. Lists are bad for FA</li></ul>
<ul><li>Allegories and Allusions (specific to other lore). Rename to Cultural Allusions, and prosify.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Back-References. What is this? Get it out of here!</li></ul>
<ul><li>Spin offs. No. Get rid of this, maybe have seperate sections on Video game, novel, ect, with each section providing a link to the respective main article</li></ul>
<p>Get right onto the things I've suggested, get it looking more like <a href="/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Sith" class="mw-redirect" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a> (see that in terms of how to structure the article), <a href="/wiki/Richard_III_(1955_film)" title="Richard III (1955 film)">Richard III (1955 film)</a> (my own FA), or, in my opinion, the best Film article around, <a href="/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca (film)</a>. Once you've done that, well, you might have an FA on your hands. The hard part (the citing) has been done, so in reality, you're on easy street. <a href="/wiki/User:Thefourdotelipsis" title="User:Thefourdotelipsis">....</a><sub>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thefourdotelipsis" title="User talk:Thefourdotelipsis">Complain</a>)</sub><sup>(<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Thefourdotelipsis" title="Special:Contributions/Thefourdotelipsis">Let us to it pell-mell</a>)</sup> 10:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul><li><ul><li>I agree with alot of what the above user said, but I have some suggestions:</li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd>Is it standard to have an <i>All Movie Guide profile</i> link in the infobox?</dd>
<dd>Make sure there are no lone lines/short stub-like paragraphs, e.g the final line of the plot.</dd>
<dd>Sub-plot is okay to keep, though turn it into paragraphs, and make it less speculative.</dd>
<dd>Cast, see <a href="/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)" title="V for Vendetta (film)">V for Vendetta</a>, this is a must.</dd>
<dd>Production needs more references, I would merge <i>Marlon Brando's role</i> into the cast description, once you model the section after other FAs.</dd>
<dd>Deleted scenes needs to be expanded and referenced.</dd>
<dd>Trailers and TV spots is no good, create a section on promotion or something. Get rid of as many ex.links in the text as possible.</dd>
<dd>Reactions is not very good. See other FAs.</dd>
<dd>Box office results needs tyo be expanded or moved into a cleaned up Reactions.</dd>
<dd>Merge IMAX 3D release into my proposed Promotion/Release section.</dd>
<dd>Connections to Superman and Superman II must be turned into paragraphs, and have a few references.</dd>
<dd>Same goes for Allegories and Allusions (specific to other lore).</dd>
<dd>Trivia, removeentirely, and grab what is actually useful content, merge it into appropriate sections.</dd>
<dd>Other back-references, merge into Ref. to Sup. I and II (change title to ref. to other Sup. media?)</dd>
<dd>Change the title of Spin-offs, though keep them together, as if you seperate them, they will all be too short. No dot points. Perhaps merge Documentary into here as well, or more appropriately, into Promotion/Release.</dd>
<dd>Take&#160;? out of Sequel? title. Expand andf reference. <a href="/wiki/User:Cvene64" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 04:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Its very good for an obscure film. All the images need <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use rationale</a>, and the image gallery should be removed as its extraneous copyrighted material. The first sentence needs to be rewritten; it may be uncommon but I don't think its "unqiue" to combine live action and animation and "for adults only" should be removed. At least rewrite it to say its an "adult film". The word "recently" (with clasified as a cult film) and "young" (with Al Sharpton) should be removed as those are time sensitive words. The only other issue I had is with the long Roger Ebert sentence in parenthesis in the intro. It would best if that was turned into its own seperate sentence.

<p>As has been raised in the articles talk page, there is a lack of good sourcing, a vast amount of speculation and a large section of the article which has questionable POV.

<p>I've taken this very important article concerning evolution (which was a real mess) pretty far in the past couple of days, but I'm not sure where to go from here.  Any ideas will be appreciated.  <a href="/wiki/User:BenB4" title="User:BenB4">BenB4</a> 01:53, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul><li>First off, unfortunately "this is the only illustration I could find, and I can't draw" isn't a legitimate fair use rationale. Try the {{reqimage}} or {{reqdiagram}} templates instead.
<dl><dd>Why isn't that a legitimate fair use rationale? <a href="/wiki/User:BenB4" title="User:BenB4">BenB4</a> 23:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(edit-conflicted explanation) For essentially the same reason that, as described in the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Fair_use" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> policy, it's not legitimate to use a copyrighted photo of a person to illustrate an article about the <i>person</i> rather than one about the specific photograph in question. It's also considered important to use or create a free image where possible rather than using a fair-use one. <strike>The image and diagram request templates can attract good diagram-creators who can help - I'd try it myself, but my previous image efforts have been... rather bad&#160;:)</strike> looks like you've attracted a few. <a href="/wiki/User:Opabinia_regalis" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 23:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul><li>I think it's buried somewhere in the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MoS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MoS">MoS</a> that headers shouldn't repeat the title, but the sections would read much better as "natural speciation" and "artificial speciation".
<dl><dd>Done. <a href="/wiki/User:BenB4" title="User:BenB4">BenB4</a> 23:48, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>
<li>A more extensive discussion of the Galapagos would be useful, as it's the best-known example of the phenomenon.</li>
<li>The "observed examples" link to talk.origins is well-researched and useful as an external link, but surely there's a more academic compilation somewhere?
<dl><dd>I don't think so.  I've looked.  If there is, I can't find one. The talk.origins faq is pretty well sourced, with plenty of peer-reviewed science citations. <a href="/wiki/User:BenB4" title="User:BenB4">BenB4</a> 23:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>
<li>A discussion of phylogenetics and the measurement of species coalescence times might be a good expansion.</li></ul>

<p>I haven't worked on this article much, but as a fan of the series, I find it extremely disappointing that other fans couldn't have done better in certain spots of the article. You know, not enough citations, that type of thing. If there's anything else in the article that needs to be improved, mention it here and/or on the series' talk page. Perhaps you, I, and some other fans of the series can try and whip this article into top shape.

<ul><li><strike>There's a bit of info in the biography that could be moved out into other sections: the part that discusses some songs in detail, and the "family life" section, which doesn't fit chronologically.</strike></li>
<li>The extensive thematic analysis could certainly use some references — surely enough professionally-written reviews and essays can be found on someone like him, especially in print? Also, it's primarily an analysis of his songs — what about the other material? And if you're going to analyze the songs, why not go into the <i>music</i> in more detail as well?

<li>In fact, create an actual list of references <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">per style</a>.</li>
<li>Long lists are generally not a good idea on Wikipedia. Particularly, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a repository of lists of quotations</a>. If the quote is relevant, use it to back up other text; otherwise take it away to <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen">his Wikiquote page</a>.</li>
<li>Don't link to a word in the middle of a song title; expand on the info outside of the quotation marks.</li>
<li>Try not to phrase parenthetical asides with words like "note".</li>
<li><strike>Clip down the external links a bit; individual YouTube clips can go. For articles containing useful information, use them as references and include them that way.</strike></li></ul></dd>

<p>I have been trying to get this article up to Featured Article standard, and believe that so far I've been pretty successful: it's been approved as a Good Article, after having had a complete re-write by myself last month. I nominated it as a Featured Article Candidate recently, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Eurovision_Song_Contest/archive2" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Eurovision Song Contest/archive2">but the nomination failed</a> - primarily because there weren't enough references, and some sections did not have enough detail. I was holding back on some of the detail because I believed that Featured Articles had to be limited in length to max 30k, but was since told that a large article was not a barrier to being featured. I have re-written some things, improved them, and added many references - even going to the extent of buying a hard-copy book in order to use it for offline reference. I believe that the article is excellent, and should be featured - but before I re-submit it for candidacy, I request a Peer Review so that perhaps others may see things which I don't. Ten heads are better than one, when it comes to these things&#160;:)
</p><p>Please give me your feedback on this article's readiness to be re-submitted as a Featured Candidate. I have addressed all the addressable points in the first FA nomination, but want more people to give their opinions before I try again. Thanks! <a href="/wiki/User:Eurosong" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Eurosong" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 14:51, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul><li>First of all, do accept my apology for not replying to your request for review earlier. I have actually injured my hand and typing takes me a lot more time, which in turn made me develop a singificant WikiBacklog... Furthermore, I want to express my deep appreciation for the extensive efforts you have undertaken to further improve this article and your dedication to this task. Please, however, note that it is my opinion that all articles should be appraised against the same criteria, and not the author's efforts. Some topics are simply broader and tougher to write a comprehensive and all-round-good article on, and therefore will require much more effort from the editors. On the other hand, I believe that the satisfaction from finally reaching the FA target with such articles is greater.<br />Let me review this section by section:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><b>Lead section</b>
<ol><li>I am still not convinced that Al-Jazeera and the other site I commented on the last time are the best references for ESC viewing figures. I think EBU released some official info as to the ESC viewership this year, and more historic data can perhaps be found in the EBU archive.</li>
<li>Even though the participants are commonly referred to as "countries", even during the show and by the organisers, the lead section should explains who the participants actually are and what is meant by "countries" (e.g. brodcasters, jury/televoting etc.)</li>
<li>The last paragraph does not fit in well, I believe - first of all, it doesn't really summarize any section of the text, secondly, the current lineup displayed there is quite disputable (were Mocedades really such big format international superstars like ABBA?), and you will have fans perpetually "promoting" their favorites by adding them to the list (e.g. Lordi's or Anna Vissi's main claim to international fame is actually appearing on ESC rather than anything else). It's going to be controversial, I'd simply do away with it, as it doesn't really provide the casual reader with much insight into the contest.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Origins</b>
<ol><li>Very good section, as it was before. I really appreciate the realiable-looking references, though I actually haven't checked them thoroughly... I'd say the middle paragraph could use a reference too - even a trivial one - to keep up with the standard.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Format</b>
<ol><li>This section could still use some development. It doesn't read to well, especially the first paragraph. It's more like a collection of facts dumped together - I think for the casual reader the description might not be that informative. It would be sensible to explain the contest format by discussing the idea behind it.</li>
<li>Again "countries" should be explained.</li>
<li>Postcards and interval acts deserve are kind-of mentioned by the way, while the fact that the event is opened by a presenter is highlighted - I guess the accents are a bit misplaced. I guess presenters, postcards and interval acts all deserve short descriptions - minisections or just paragraphs.</li>
<li>Sadly, no references in this section.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Participation</b>
<ol><li>Another rather good section here, but insufficient references! What in the world is the "European Broadcasting Area"?</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Rules</b>
<ol><li>The introductory sentences are both pretty tautologic to me and quite redundant.</li>
<li>Some "hosting rules" and all "other rules" are not referenced. The existance of "other notable rules" section makes me wonder whether there are any non-notable rules.</li>
<li>It is still not explained why would BBC or, in one case, NOS step in as the organiser when the winner declined.</li>
<li>For clarity and better reading I would start the "live music" section with the rules about vocals and then proceed to the discussion of the orchestra. There is no mention of the countries supplying their conductors along with singers in the "orchestra period".</li>
<li>Again, I would start the language section with saying that "songs can now be sung in any language" and only then discuss the historic divertions from the rule. This section is also quit choppy and there is no explanation as to why would the rules go back and forth, and the perceived better chances of songs sung in English. I am also not that happy that there is no mention of imaginary and rare languages any longer - I know somebody was fussy about the rumblings on what language could UK use, but the rest of that section was perfectly legitimate.</li>
<li>Broadcasting rules - reference needed for the rule, as well as formal consequences for the broadcaster. It would also be interesting to discuss, here or elsewhere, NON-participating brodcasters who show the Contest, like the mentioned one from Jordan, or I recently heard about even an Australian one!</li>
<li>I remember <a href="/wiki/Lys_Assia" title="Lys Assia">Lys Assia</a> said in an interview <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2005/english/1825.htm">[6]</a> that in the beginning all the artists, incl. composer, lyricist, singers etc. had to be from the country they represented. It would be good to try to dig out how it was applied in practice and when the rule was abolished.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Selection procedures</b>
<ol><li>Missing references again&#160;:(</li>
<li>First and last paragraphs belongs in the previous section</li>
<li>I believe a more systematic discussion of the preselection events/procedures in participating countries and their evolution would be better here - like the influence of Melodifestivalen and later Operacion Triunfo on other countries, the prevailing types of preselections and their historic development (like when did the televoting era begin).</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Voting</b>
<ol><li>The first paragraph is one of the few places in text where phrases like "the system which people are most familiar with" appears - this is something of a weasel phrase, and as such statement doesn't really change much, I would avoid that to fend off criticism during prospective FA candidacy.</li>
<li>Missing references again, I am especially interested in how was the televoting experiment a success (I mean how was the "successfulness" determined?)</li>
<li>Are there any countries other than Monaco that still use juries? Is there a country that uses a mixed system?</li>
<li>The first sentence of the "presentation of votes" subsection might not be understand correctly by readers unfamiliar with the show.</li>
<li>I recall seeing a footage of all juries sitting in the studio where the contest was staged and just giving out votes live, so I think it wasn't given by telephone everytime before satellite transmission.</li>
<li>I think that countries have been giving out votes by order of performance, and later when also countries whose songs didn't participate in the final were voting, in alphabetical order, and only this year a special draw of "voting order" was introduced.</li>
<li>I think that Scandinavian countries boycotted the 1970 ESC because of the tie, and this is why EBU was forced to devise tie-break rules.</li>
<li>Discussing what-if in case of the 1991 tie-break is unnecessary.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Expansion of the Contest</b>
<ol><li>First paragraph belongs in the "Participation" section, the second in the "Format" section.</li>
<li>The remaining three subsections are actually rules and belong in this section.</li>
<li>Did I mention insufficient referencing? :D</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Semi-Final</b>
<ol><li>Oh, OK, now I understand, more or less, some structuring peculiarities here. I have a proposition of a general rule that would make the article more reader-friendly - discuss the event as is today, and then proceed to go through the historic developments. For example, the semi should be discussed in the format section, then the rules of qualification with the historic perspective in the rules section.</li>
<li>Although I think it never happened, if one of the Big 4 was in the top ten, they wouldn't be counted and the following country, like 11th etc, would gain the right to go straight to the Final next year - this should be clarified.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Hosting</b>
<ol><li>The second and third paragraphs desperately need references!</li>
<li>Otherwise, a very nice section.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Comentators</b>
<ol><li>This section unnecessairly breaks up the nice flow between "Hosting" and "Eurovision Week". I would move it somewhere upwards.</li>
<li>I guess presenters, interval acts, postcards, composers, conductors, lyricists etc. could be considered for such sections too.</li>
<li>It just occured to me, and I think it is not mentioned anywhere (or perhaps I am that unconscious at 4 AM) that the prize was actually originally meant more for the authors of the song than the artist - somehow this got lost along the way, I still remember the composer of Sweden 1999 getting the prize on stage (a memorable moment for some other reason&#160;;) ). This year, Mr. Lordi got the award - was he the composer and lyricist, or were the authors deprived of the prize sometime earlier?</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Eurovision week</b>
<ol><li>I have commented on it already the last time, it is still a very nice section, even though it lacks references (which obviously needs to be rectified). The last subsection is a little choppy.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Winners</b>
<ol><li>The first paragraph actually only pertains to the artists, so it should go into that section.</li>
<li>Other than the lack of references, another really good section!</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Criticism</b>
<ol><li>The discussion of musical styles and typical performance styles thorugh the years deserves a separate section, not only devoted to criticisms.</li>
<li>Block and political voting should be discussed alongside voting in general, it is not only a subject of criticism, it's simply a matter of fact. For many people, it is an interesting feature rather than a reason for criticism. So, confining this to a "criticism" section only narrows the issue unnecessairly.</li>
<li>I am, in general, opposed to "criticisms" sections, as their existence might imply that there are no "criticisms" of the subjects whose articles do not contain such sections, and also this relegates the comments on some various issues to an obscure section at the end of the article, rather than them being located directly where the issues are discussed. I believe it is more natural for them to be discussed there. For example the criticism of different entry selection systems is more or less discussed in that section, and I believe it is much more comprehensible for the common reader that way.</li>
<li>Moreover, the "Criticisms" sections can be accused of being attempts by the editor to smuggle some POV by downplaying them or supplying counterarguments. This can be an obstacle during FA candidacy.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>To sum it up - the article has surely improved and is getting really close to the FA status. I understand that it took some very tiresome work and it can really be disheartening to read that people still have some many gripes about it. But please don't dismiss them, as they will be popping out later during FAC. I believe you need more editors to help you, I am sorry I can't contribute that much at that moment, as it already took a sleepless night to type all that with the fingers I have available at that moment :D<br />I think you might ask guys who put together fan sites like esctoday for assistance - if not with editing articles directly, than at least with helping finding out some peculiarities, like the ones with the rules, and sources. I already have some experience with asking enthusiasts of other subjects for help, and I can tell you it works (not 100%, but still).<br />Again, I want to reassure you that I want to see this article become an FA as much as you do, and I really appreciate your really extensive efforts in that direction! I hope you won't let fatigue get you so close to the finish line! I hope to be able to be more helpful soon.

<p>Hi Bravada, thank you very much - again - for your comments. I especially appreciate it because you obviously spent a long time reviewing the article, and it must have taken you even longer to type this all out - especially with an injured hand! I hope it gets better soon.
I am replying to your comments here below, because you used numbered lists in your critique - as you did in the previous FAC. In order to preserve those numbers, I was forced to write in bold, because if I were to have started new lines with indents after each comment (which would have been prefereble), then the numbered lists would have gone wrong. So.. here goes:
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Lead section</b>
<ol><li><b>Re: viewing figures</b>, perhaps you could help me? I find references on the EBU's site to "over 100 million viewers", but nothing other than that. I do know that people have quoted the figures as vastly higher than that, however - once I heard "one billion viewers", but I think this was just a poor guess. However, the figure of 600 million has been heard fairly often. Perhaps the Aljazeera site is not the best source, but it <i>is</i> a source - at least to show the reader, and to back up the article's statement that these figures have been quoted. As the article says, the figures are quoted.. it is not giving a definitive figure, simply because there are a lot of contradicting sources out there. There is surprisingly little of use that I can find on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Aebu.ch+eurovision+viewing+figures&amp;btnG=Search">EBU's site</a>. If you can find something better, please let me know - or edit it yourself&#160;:) - <b>Aljazeera <i>is</i> actually a good reference: it's the largest news network which spans Arab countries. Just because it's not European, that doesn't mean it's not relevant&#160;:)</b></li>
<li><s><b>Re labelling participants as "countries"</b>. Hmm... ok, I shall think about this&lt;(s&gt;, and try to make it clearer through the whole article. - <b>Addressed</b></s></li><s>
<li><s><b>Re: list of stars to have graced the stage</b>. You're quite right about this list being open to edits by fans wishing to "promote" their favourite artists into it. It has already been happening. However, I do think that there should at least be <i>some</i> mention, in the article's lead, of some of the biggest stars who have participated in the Contest. As the WP guidelines say, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PEACOCK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PEACOCK">"Don't hide the important facts"</a>. To the casual reader who does not know much about the Contest, it is important that they realise exactly how big the thing is: that it's not just some obscure talent show full of nobodies. Perhaps you can suggest an alternative, to be included in the lead?</s> <b>Addressed: removed this list from the lead. Replaced with a mention of musical styles.</b></li></s></ol></dd><s>
<dd><b>Origins</b>
<ol><li><s><b>Re: reference in the middle paragraph</b>. Hmm, ok... I shall include one.</s> - <b>Addressed</b></li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Format</b>
<ol><li><b>Re: discussing "the idea behind it" in the "Format" section</b>. Isn't the idea behind the Contest discussed already in the "Origins" section? In this Format section, I am trying to mention the things which have always been the case - the bare-bone basics of the Contest. The things quintessential to the idea of the Contest which, if changed, would make it no longer the Eurovision Song Contest. More minor format developments, such as the way in which voting is conducted exactly, and the presence of the semi-final, have changed over the years. I have tried to make this "basic format" section static, to show what is the case <i>every</i> single year, no matter what.</li>
<li><s><b>Re: countries</b>. Shall be looked at.</s> - <b>Clarified</b></li>
<li><b>Re: weight given to presenter, postcards and interval acts</b>. I shall think about this one.</li>
<li><b>Re: references</b>. See my comments below about references.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Participation</b>
<ol><li><s><b>Re: European Broadcasting Area</b>. Good point. I created a (red) Wikilink to it, with the thought of sometime creating that article.. but you're right: the area should be briefly defined right here in this article. I shall address this, thank you.</s> - <b>Addressed and referenced.</b></li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Rules</b>
<ol><li><s><b>Re: redundant introduction</b>. That is there because all the rules I have mentioned fall into some sub-category, and without some kind of introductory sentence, the sub-heading would immediately follow the section heading, which looks a bit strange. I don't know how you feel about that. Is that acceptable? If not, then... what else should I write as an introduction to the section?</s> - <b>Addressed: wrote better, more relevant introduction</b></li>
<li><s><b>Re: notable rules</b>. There are very many rules of the Contest - but many of them deal with things which are non-essential to the workings of the Contest, such as rules which specify exactly how many seconds of screen-time sponsors are allowed to display their logos, and when participating broadcasters must make a back-up recording of the transmission feed of the rehearsals, etc. I classify these as non-notable... because if they were all to be included, then we may as well have the entire text of the rules included here, mentioning every single little rule. Hmm.. Perhaps I can make a mention of this in the intro. I shall see about references.</s> - <b>Addressed, as above</b></li>

<li><s><b>Re: references and consequences for broadcaster</b>. I shall look into this. Also - yes, thanks for reminding me about non-participating broadcasters. This definitely needs a mention.</s> - <b>Addressed: non-participants mentioned now in the lead. Refs made in Broadcasting Rules section. With regards to mentioning "how the rule is now" (freedom of language mentioned first), I disagree. See my note above about wanting the article to be static, and to make as few references to "this is how it is today" as possible.</b></li>
<li><s><b>Re: older requirement for participants to come from that country</b>. Good point. I shall try to, as you say, dig out this information.</s> - <b>I never actually heard of a nationality restriction before I saw that interview with Lys Assia you mentioned. I tried to find any other references to it, but there are none. I then asked the Eurovision fan community if they had any references to it, and I was reminded that the German entrant in 1956 was actually Austrian - and Lys herself had entered the German final! That rather shows that there was never a rule restricting the nationality. Perhaps Lys got confused when quoting that, referring instead to some Swiss pre-selection rules? Individual countries may impose any further rules they wish, but here we are discussing the EBU's general rules. Good point: this has now been mentioned!</b></li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Selection procedures</b>
<ol><li><b>Re: missing references</b>. I shall have a look.. but again, see my note below.</li>
<li><b>Re: first and last paragraphs</b>. I disagree. See my note below about rules and sections.</li>

<li><s><b>Re: juries still in use</b>. I shall try to find out.</s> - <b>Can't find any reliable sources saying that any particular countries used backup juries in 2006. The rule is that televoting shall be used, anyway.. and nothing is mentioned otherwise. Backup juries are only there as a backup. The article gives this information as it stands. Nothing to address</b></li>
<li><b>Re: confusion of first sentence by readers unfamiliar with the show</b>. People are supposed to be reading the article in order. If they don't, I can not be blamed for their non-understanding, when a later part of the article makes reference to something already established earlier. I presume you're talking about the bit where I mention the interval act, yes? If not, please elaborate.</li>

<dd><b>Expansion of the Contest</b></dd>
<dd><b>Re: your proposal to move these paragraphs elsewhere</b>
<dl><dd>Okay, this needs a much longer reply. I <i>very strongly</i> disagree with you here. Technically speaking, almost everything in the article could be discussed also under other sections, as there is considerable overlap. However, the expansion of the Contest is a very big deal in its own right. The Contest was pretty stable until 1993, and only then - after there became more countries wishing to participate than there was time in the Contest for - did the rules start changing almost every year, in order to try and find the best system to solve the problem. The expansion of the Contest has been a <b>major</b> theme in the past 13 years of Eurovision's history. It needs its own section, including an explanation of exactly how, why and when the relevant rule and procedure changes came about. To dissolve this section, and incorporate the information into other sections would fail to highlight to the reader the importance of the theme of the Contest's expansion, and the impact which the new countries have had on it.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Semi-Final</b>
<ol><li><b>Re: your proposed changes to the layout of the article</b>. I'm not too sure about this. One of the things I had in mind, when I completely re-wrote the article, is that I wanted to keep it as static as possible. If the article were to be included on the proposed Wikipedia CD, for example, then I want it to remain relevant and true for as long as possible. The fact is, the rules and format of the Contest have been changing <i>almost every year</i>, for the past ten years! Therefore I didn't want to write an article which starts off saying "this is how the Contest is today" - and then that text would be hopelessly out-of-date a couple of years down the line. That's why I have tried, as much as possible, to focus on the basic evergreen principles of the event, which do not change over time - and the discuss the changing history under relevant, topical section headings. You'll notice that a few times I say things like "as of 2006", instead of "to date" (or similar). With this in mind, do you still propose that the article starts off by explaining how the Contest is today? When it could be included on a WP CD, and then two years later it's inaccurate?</li></ol></dd>

We don't need a whole separate section on composers.. any notable composers of notable songs should by mentioned in that song's article.</b></li>
<li><s><b>Re: prize going to songwriters</b>. This <i>is</i> still (and has always been) the case. Mr Lordi got the award this year because he wrote the song, not because he performed it. The fact that he was also a performer is not relevant. Yes - the trophy is awarded to the winning songwriter. This never got lost along the way&#160;:) This is mentioned in the article.</s> - <b>Answered your question right here&#160;:) Nothing to change in the article, it's correct as it is.</b></li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Eurovision week</b>
<ol><li><s><b>Re: references in this section</b>. Please see my note about references below.</s> How is the last subsection "choppy"? - <b>Added references to this section</b></li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Winners</b>
<ol><li><b>Re: first paragraph</b>. You're right, it does only pertain to the artists. However, again - if it were not there, then there would be nothing to separate section headings. Perhaps I should then also mention something about winning countries in that paragraph.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>Criticism</b>
<ol><li><b><s>Re: discussion of musical styles</s></b> (Addressed in lead) <b>and typical performance styles thorugh the years</b>. What would you write, in a separate section here? The music is vastly diverse - it's impossible to "define" a Eurovision song in an encyclopædia. Unless you want to write such things as "The first rap song in the Contest appeared as late as 1995"...</li>
<li><b>Re: "Block and political voting should be discussed alongside voting in general"</b>. Disagree. I have tried to keep the "voting" section concentrated simply on the voting procedures and presentation, as per the format and rules of the Contest. Not to go into <i>actual examples</i> of voting patterns. Those belong in the separate sub-article. If I were to start discussing voting patterns in the main article, then the section could be expanded to be as long as the whole rest of the article!</li>
<li><b>Re: your objection to "criticisms" sections</b>. Where in the WP guidelines does it say the things you said? You said that their existence might imply that there are no "criticisms" of the subjects whose articles do not contain such sections. Well... there <i>are</i> really no notable (and certainly not <b>referenced</b>!) criticisms of other aspects of the Contest, are there? What would you have me include? A note about how some fans bemoan the loss of the orchestra? Such things are relatively minor, and there are no good references for such things. However, the Contest <i>is</i> well-known for being accused of political voting bias, and there are many references to back up this criticism.</li>
<li><b>Re: possible accusations of downplay of criticism</b>. You seem to contradict yourself here. On one hand you're saying that having a criticisms section could be construed as downplaying them. However, in the preceding point you said it is more natural for criticisms to be discussed in their relevant sections. Surely to have a whole separate section entitled "Criticisms" serves to <i>highlight</i> these points! To downplay them would be to "smuggle them in" to the relevant sections.</li></ol></dd>
<dd><b>The "see below" reply to references</b></dd>
<dd>I think I mentioned this in my response to the FAC points, but no-one gave me a counter reply. There is surprisingly little which has actually been published in hard-copy about Eurovision over the years (in English, anyway!). This makes it hard to find references for every little thing. I have tried my best to include decent web references for many things, but... it seems like you are picking holes in many paragraphs and sections, accusing them of having no references. Not every little statement needs references, though. Surely the purpose of references is so that any major statement of fact can be checked, if it might otherwise be disputed - or any sentence involved in the quotation of statistics. Obviously such statements as the fact that Melodifestivalen is the most-watched TV programme of the year in Sweden, do need references.. as they're bold statements, and should definitely be verifiable. As indeed I have included a reference for this. However, there are other statements which are made which are a) not bold, disputable statements and b) simply do not have published references. You say that "sadly there are no references" in the "Format" section. Well... does it need any? Which statements <i>need</i> references? There are no bold, questionable statements here. The "verifiability" of the format can be seen simply by watching one of the Contests! Just because there are no references in a whole section, that does not mean that the section is bad - and therefore it is a barrier to the article attaining Featured status. Perhaps the section in question simply does not need references? There are many Featured Articles which I have seen, which have <i>very</i> few references. See <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">Supply and demand</a>, for example. I do accept your point that some articles require a lot more in order to attain Featured status than others - and yes, Eurovision is a big topic which needs a lot of work. But still, it does get tiresome when the major knockbacks of a nomination come from people saying that there are not enough references. A complaint about references should only be made if someone sees a statement which surprises them, and which they may dispute, but the statement is not referenced (and therefore could have been inserted into the article by a troublemaker wishing to mislead). The entire lead section to <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">Supply and demand</a> contains not one single reference, although it includes several statements which could possibly be questioned.</dd>
<dd>You suggested that I use esctoday for references. Well, as I stated in the FAC, I am reluctant to use fan sites as reference points. The reason for this is simple: I am Chris Melville, webmaster of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.eurosong.net">eurosong.net</a>. I have my own unofficial fan site, and consequently, if I wanted to, I could just make up all the references I ever wished to do, by publishing anything I liked on my own site, and then using it as a reference in an encyclopædia article! I strongly believe that fan webmasters should be discouraged from using fan websites as reference points, for <i>any</i> article on Wikipedia. Fans - especially Eurovision fans - have a certain way of seeing things, which is rarely encyclopædic. I am discounting myself here, when writing this article, as I am writing in as encyclopædic style as I can. If I wanted to push my POV, then I would write "Eurovision is the greatest thing in the whole world"&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>So, to sum up: please do not dismiss the article simply because some paragraphs and sections do not have references <i>per se</i>. If there is a single, disputable statement which is unreferenced, then please let me know about it. In the Featured Articles candidates page, I see an increasing number of reviewers dismissing articles due to lack of references, without actually saying which statements need them. This is a trend that I think we should be getting away from.</dd></s></dl><s><dl><dd>And, to sum up more finally - thank you for your comments. I really do appreciate them, especially because they have been written with an injured hand! I have marked the points I will address in the article. But please respond to my other comments too. Some of the things you said, especially about layout of the article, seem to be simply your own POV, in the way that you would have written the article had it been yourself working on it recently. These are not WP guidelines, and it should not be a barrier to an article attaining featured status, just because another editor would have written it differently. I am glad that you appreciate my efforts: the article is certainly a lot better now than it was before I re-wrote it, when I had slapped a cleanup tag on it because <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eurovision_Song_Contest&amp;oldid=59997273">it was in a terrible state</a>! Thanks&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/User:Eurosong" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Eurosong" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 14:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, hello Chris!</dd>
<dd>Nice site you've got there, though your visitors obviously know nothing about song quality - Serteb in the first place?&#160;;)
<dl><dd><i>Thanks&#160;:) Sertab's in first place because just before ESC2006, I had thousands of Turks registering and giving Turkish entries 10/10. It's a problem I need to deal with... I do allow people to vote for their own country, but only after I make them "sign" an honesty pledge which states that they will only vote with their heart according to how much they like the <b>song</b>, and not just support their own country. Unfortunately it looks like many people ignore it, but it's impossible for me to prove that any one individual is not voting with their heart! I'm working on it&#160;:)</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>OK, we've only had one review her by a person injured in more ways than one (does ego count?) and a reply and we're already over 30k! Let's get back to business...
<dl><dd><i>Your ego is injured? How do? I hope it's nothing I said. Again, I do greatly appreciate your input here: it's already made the article improve a lot!</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Where do I start? Ok, let's do references first:
<ul><li><b>References</b></li></ul></dd>
<dd>I do believe an article needs references - it is the only proof it does not contain original research (it is also a good self-check). I know it's hard, tedious and annoying to have to find references for absolutely obvious stuff, but, well, that's how the whole encyclopedia thing works. The old Featured Articles are sometimes missing references, it's because WP has been evolving. If you notice one w/o references, you should probably nominate it for delisting. That said, it should probably be quite easy to find good references for <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">Supply and demand</a> and I feel quite guilty for not doing that now given my background...
<dl><dd><i>What is your background? Are you an economist?&#160;:) At this point I'd like to draw your attention to today's FA, <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a>. See the list of references at the bottom. Over half the so-called "references" are quotes from the actual game itself. In order for the casual reader to be able to use these references to verify facts, then they would have to go and actually play the game and familiarise themselves with the characters. And this is a FA... what difference, then, to simply make use of such references as "Watch the Eurovision Song Contest and you'll see!"? I could easily just say such things. Final Fantasy X is good enough to be a FA when half the references are self-references.</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>As concerns ESC fansites, there are many, but some are better than others. ESCtoday seems quite professionally edited and I have even learned the guy behind it is now employed by the EBU itself to revamp the official Eurovision site. If you have a problem with a reference, I think this might be a good bet, so many sources actually cite it - I even see your own site is using their news feeds!
<dl><dd><i>Yes, Sietse (the webmaster) has been offered a job with the EBU, which is great for him. However, there is one caveat I should mention. ESCtoday is indeed a very good site, and the editors do a lot of good work. It also looks very polished and professional, with slick graphics. However, a lot of the time, the English used is a bit dodgy. The writing style is also often somewhat less-than-formal, with sensationalist exclamation marks peppered around the place, and this is not exactly what one would hope for when seeking a formal reference. Such words as "newsitems" do not exist in English. You see, I put a great deal of importance in correct English, and much of my activity on Wikipedia involves correcting mistakes. Therefore I am reluctant to refer to sources which are not written as I would wish them to be. I have also come across several facts referenced at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.partyvision.co.uk">partyvision.co.uk</a>: a site which could have been used as a reference, but I decided not to because it does not have the look and the feel of a formal, reliable source (even though the information is correct).</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>But ultimately the solution I tried to suggest to you is to turn to people who run really information-rich sites to chip in their knowledge and years of devotion to ESC to help you find references (and perhaps also enrich the article with more info). I think it's always better to get some help, and I think at least some of them can help you immensely with this article.
<dl><dd><i>Hmm. How much bigger can the article get? It's already 53k. I have expanded it a lot, after you told me that there was no barrier on FAs being over 30k. However, surely there must be some reasonable limit. I mean, if there were really no limits then I could write ten times the amount which is currently there, giving an extremely detailed complete history of the Contest! But that's what sub-articles are for. In the main article, I believe that a concise and informative overview of the whole Contest should be given, including as much detail as it required in each of the sections to leave the reader feeling that they have a complete understanding of what the ESC is and how it works. Matters such as detailed voting patterns - who gives 12 points to who else most frequently, etc - do not belong in the main article</i></dd></dl></dd>

</p><p>Some suggestions, with FAC in mind:
</p></s><s><ul><li>The lead is too short, for an article of this size it should be about three paragraphs. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>.</li>
<li>Try to convert some of the bulleted lists to prose, this is a common objection on FAC.</li>
<li>There are a few one paragraph subsections in the later stages of the article, try to merge some of these where possible.</li>
<li>There is a mix of referencing styles. Convert the inline external links to the format used elsewhere in the article.</li>
<li>The article needs going over with a fine-toothed comb to smooth out awkward prose. Taking the first paragraph of the first section as an example:
<ul><li><i>As of the 22 June 2003, opening date of the extension to San Francisco International Airport and Millbrae, the BART system comprises 104 miles (167 km) of track and 43 stations.</i> reads awkwardly - something like "Following the opening of an extension to San Francisco International Airport and Millbrae on 22 June 2003, the BART system comprises 104 miles (167 km) of track and 43 stations." would be better.</li>
<li>2nd and 3rd sentences - the fact that the guage is non-standard is repeated.</li>
<li>Last sentence - the words "This" and "relatively" are redundant. I've made changes to this paragraph, but the whole article needs to be examined thoroughly.</li></ul></li></ul></s><s><p>Hope this helps. <a href="/wiki/User:Oldelpaso" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 19:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

</p><p>A few points, mostly focusing on style rather than content:
</p></s><s><ul><li>Subheadings are overused. For example, the "Education" subheading is unneeded as education fits under "early life" without it. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/(headings)" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/(headings)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style/(headings)</a>. Several subsections should be merged in the <i>Vice president</i> section, and from the <i>Private citizen</i> section onwards. Ideally, the TOC should be half its current size.</li>
<li>On a similar note, one paragraph sections should be avoided where possible.</li>
<li>The article could do with a thorough copyedit, to improve akward sentences such as "Gore switched majors and worked hard in his government courses and graduated from Harvard in June 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government."</li>
<li>Try to convert bulleted lists to prose as much as possible.</li>
<li>The section on the 2004 election looks disproportionately long, given that he was not a candidate.</li>
<li>The "Internet and the Webbys" section is a mess, and should be continuous prose rather than small chunks of trivia. This section uses a different referencing style to the rest of the article.</li></ul></s><s><p>Hope this helps. <a href="/wiki/User:Oldelpaso" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 19:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

I'm a French Stade Français fan and I took the liberty of working on your contribution. I hope you won't mind...&#160;:¬) I removed the following sentence: "Stade still captured the French championship, sitting at the top of the league table." The "phases finales" as we called the knock-out phases are what matter here here. Finishing first of the regular season is irrelevant in France and it doesn't appear on records. Only the winner of the final can be said to hold the French championship. I added a couple of things about recent history (how the players got rid of their coach in 2000, e.g.). I also took care of this North/South stuff underlined by Yomangani. Tell me what you think. Take it all out if you think it's irrelevant.</li>
<li>I also have a couple of suggestions: Stade Français is first and foremost a "multisports" club (22 sections including sailing and bridge!). It was first an athletics club (many Olympic medallists, including Marie-José Pérec) and also had a fairly successful football side in the 60s-80s. I think a disambiguation page and a change of the article's name (to Stade—Français_CASG) is needed. I'm of course ready to contribute an article on Stade Français (the multisports one). The same is true of Racing Club de France, another multisports club, also famous for its athletics and football sections, whose rugby section merged with US Metro a few years back. I'm going to add a few lines about this in the Racing Club de France article.</li></ul></dd></dl></s><s><p>That's it! I look forward to hearing from you.

<ul><li>Advertising Age ranked the <i>jingle</i> in the top 10, not the campaign.</li>
<li>Advertising Age gives a couple of copyright dates on that page, 1999 and 2005; from this it's reasonable to infer that the list was compiled in 1999.  Give that date.</li>
<li>The content of the second paragraph is weakly supported; it shows black people and the article content infers that they were targeted.  This is reasonable but it would be nice to have a more definitive source for that.  It doesn't necessarily convey targeting.</li>
<li>I'd hate to have to edit this because it contains the new "ref" tags which embed vast amounts of unnecessary clutter amid the content.  I do hope somebody will come up with a more sensible way of putting references into a Mediawiki article.</li></ul></dd>

<dd>As far as the article itself goes, I'd like to see an analysis of how Fred Flintstone can continue to power his car with his feet after he's smoked a pack of Winstons.  I suspect nobody has researched that, though.  To be serious, the article is interesting and well-written.  One thing that comes to mind is whether this slogan specifically had any impact on the FCC's decision to end cigarette advertising on television.  Are there any other lasting effects of the jingle, besides those mentioned in the intro?  --<a href="/wiki/User:Elkman" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Elkman" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 18:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I know the "Winston" jingle was referenced in <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, which would be a citation for popular culture. It has been mentioned in other places but I can't name them off the top of my head. As for the FCC, Congress discussed the Winston jingle as well as "<a href="/wiki/Tareyton" title="Tareyton">Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!</a>" at length, because they were the catchiest ads seen on TV, and could target the most smokers. <a href="/wiki/User:Mike_Halterman" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mike_Halterman" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 01:41, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>One point I know of (and endorse, as a grammatical <a href="/wiki/Descriptivist" class="mw-redirect" title="Descriptivist">descriptivist</a>!) is that some grammarians have defended "like a cigarette should". Right now you've got Malcolm Gladwell and a dictionary. I think there's a glaring omission, though, in that there's nothing in the article about the <b>actual taste</b> of Winstons (not that I would know). Why did they choose this selling point, and how did it fit into the cigarette advertising climate of the day? Were Winstons considered a better-tasting cigarette before the campaign? That would add helpful context. --<a href="/wiki/User:Dhartung" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dhartung" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:53, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Winstons were two months old when the "Winston tastes good" campaign started. I believe I read somewhere that what set Winstons apart from other cigarettes was that they were only carried in filters, while most cigarettes were only starting to switch from unflitered. The full Winston jingle song describes the filter advantage as "The filter lets the flavor through!"

(or needs some further clarification)</li>
<li>The section on the killing is confusing because of the use of "their" rather than "his" or "hers" (Difficult call as I assume we don't know the sex of the officer and "his/her" is ugly), "officers" to refer only to firearms officers (so you end up with "...officers and the surveillance officer...") and the interchangable use of Hotel 3 and surveillance officer. It also reads badly as Hotel 3 is 'dragged' 3 times.</li>
<li>The timeline of the article has the police revealing the reason for the shoot-to-kill policy before the Muslim Council demanding to know the reason.</li>
<li>The section on "controversy over police procedure" has no inline references which lets it down. It reads as much more POV and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a> than the rest of the article as a result.</li></ul></dd>

<dl><dd>By the way, we do have a European site as one of the critics, but the one I'd really like to have the review from is <i>EDGE</i> magazine. They are far more notorious for being hard-assed than <i>Famitsu</i> to be honest. They actually did like the game, though, and gave it a 8 out of 10. That's all I know, sadly.

<dl><dd><ul><li>Not clear from the article what 'Nielson Soundscan' is. I get it from one of the refs, but I suggest either dropping the mention of it (Is it important, does it add to the article?) or expanding just a tad to give a hint of what it is. As it is it sort of sidetracked me while reading.</li>
<li>You'll need to work on the citation of references and possibly the references themselves. Currently it's not clear where the information in the article comes from, some of it comes from the inline citations, some of it seems not to - for example the 'graduating magna cum laude' doesn't seem to appear in any of the notes. It may be in the single listed reference of course, but I can't check that.</li>
<li>The 'personal interests' section tails off into a list of facts rather than prose.</li>
<li>Overall it's a very positive article. I know nothing about the subject, but I do wonder whether the article is really <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>. You may want to check for that. Is her work universally acclaimed, or have there been any negative critical reactions? If there have, those need to be worked in as well.</li>

<li>POV seems to have largely been taken care of. I would only suggest that the <i>Plagiarism and factual accuracy</i> section be modified in order to remove Coulter's rather extensive screed about plagarism by left-wing authors. Reproducing her claims verbatim is not so much POV as it is a slide into a rather silly discussion about the relative frequency of plagarism in left-wing and right-wing books, and this (mini)discussion seems to give her the floor more than other voices in this "debate".</li></ul></s><s><p>Now for the hard part. I believe that this article would benefit from a (short) discussion of Coulter's place among the American right: those who have influenced her (not just a list of names.. a little bit more in depth) and about her relationship with the current U.S. right. For instance, I know <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Sullivan" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> has harshly criticized her. Are there others? Who are her most prominent supporters? We need a little context, of course without veering off into original research. Furthermore, the article needs to at least mention the whole "invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity" bit. This <i>was</i> unique caused a bit of a stir.

Trend of young adult fiction? It kinda seems hard that the genre of young adult fiction suddenly was created so late. I mean, it's a pretty broad genre there.

Points to make:
<ul><li><strike>All of the "(English)" tags in the references should be removed. English is assumed by default. Those language tags should only clutter the references when the ref is not English. An exception I could see is if English was the minority of the references (e.g. only 2 English refs with 20 Japanese). Go ahead and keep them for the external links though.</strike></li>
<li><strike>I think ISBNs are generally written without the hyphens in them.</strike> (I checked: both are used, but mostly without. <a href="/wiki/User:Elric_of_Grans" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a>)</li>
<li><strike>"(English) Kadono, Kōhei [2001-02-01] (2006-04-24). Boogiepop Never Laughs. Seven Seas Entertainment. ISBN 1-933164-18-2, 187." Why are there two dates?</strike></li>
<li><strike>The Terminology section is really iffy. Should be worked into the text.</strike></li>
<li><strike>Not sure if you understand how <a href="/wiki/Romaji" class="mw-redirect" title="Romaji">romaji</a> works really, but all long vowels in <a href="/wiki/Katakana" title="Katakana">katakana</a> are supposed to use macrons (thus, Bugiipoppu shiriizu → Bugīpoppu shirīzu) I'll go ahead and fix this for you. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Japan-related_articles)" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)</a> for info.</strike></li>
<li><strike>"<i>To face the 'enemies of the world', the shinigami Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface.</i>" What's with the use of single quotes? Unless this is a British thing or something, I don't think it's correct. Double quote it if it's a term used all the time in the series or change it to a normal sentence. Also, it's a really bad run-on sentence.</strike> (changed to double quotes, but does not appear to be a run-on sentence. <a href="/wiki/User:Elric_of_Grans" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a>)</li>
<li><strike>A bit overkill on the dashes. Dashes should be use <i>very</i> rarely. Rewrite them using commas or parentheses. Also colons get used a bit too much. In general, there are too many advanced forms of punctuation being used, to the effect where they're being used incorrectly.</strike></li>
<li>Basically the whole thing needs a good copyedit. <strike>Example:<br /> "<i>The mission of the Towa Organisation<b>,</b> and its agents<b>,</b> is to find MPLS <b>–</b> evolved humans <b>–</b> and eliminate them<b>,</b> however, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organisation get <b>its</b> way<b>,</b> and he is <b>not the only one out to stop them</b>.</i>"<br /> →<br /> <i>The mission of the Towa Organisation and its agents is to find MPLS ([say what it stands for]; evolved humans) and eliminate them. However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organisation get his way and he is not alone in his efforts.</i><br /> That last part was just gibberish, I had to reword it. I think that's what you meant.</strike></li>

<dd>Boogiepop.  He is either a supernatural being, or Miyashita Touka has multiple personalities: we do not know for sure.  If it reads like an organisation, I shall have to fix that.</dd>

<li><i>Intro:2:1</i> - Who recognises him as an icon? Could be construed as point of view.</li>
<li><i>Intro:2:2</i> - What are "#1 singles" (I know, but a lot won't by the wording)? Worded as "He has a record twenty-nine" implies that he owns the single...so do I (maybe reword to "performed" or "written" or both, depending on what it was). Also, perhaps phrase it as twenty-nine "#1 singles" in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, rather than twenty-nine <a href="/wiki/U.S." class="mw-redirect" title="U.S.">U.S.</a> "#1 singles" (with "#1 singles" still needing improvement).</li>
<li><i>Intro:2:3</i> - "Top ten" of what? What makes his talent as a bassist "influential"?</li>
<li><i>Intro:2:4</i> - "Highly successful" is a bit much. If anything, just "successful", but even that seems POV.</li>
<li><i>Intro:3:1</i> - <a href="/wiki/Wings_(band)" class="mw-redirect" title="Wings (band)">Wings</a> is "introduced" here, but discussed earlier. Should be introduced before mentioned (I hope that makes sense).</li>
<li><i>Intro:3:3</i> - The last part doesn't need parentheses.</li>
<li><i>Intro:4</i> - Also would be better with more than one sentence. Maybe this could be combined with the first paragraph. Change "aside from" to "in addition to".</li>
<li><i>Early Years:1:1</i> - I don't think his full name is needed again here. What is <a href="/wiki/Walton" class="mw-disambig" title="Walton">Walton</a> supposed to link to?</li>
<li><i>Early Years:1:2</i> - Replace the semicolon with a period. Wikilink Roman Catholic and Protestant.</li>

<li><i>Early Years:1:5</i> - Is the location of where he traded the instrument that important. IMO it is not needed.</li>

<li><i>Early Years:2:1</i> - Wikilink "Irish" to <a href="/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish people</a>.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB):1:2</i> - Before "Stuart Sutcliffe" remove "the addition of".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB):1:4</i> - Rephrase to "McCartney took over bass guitar duties in the early 1960s following the departure of Sutcliffe, after Lennon and Harrison had declined".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(S):1:1</i> - Is "eyeball to eyeball" a good or bad thing? What is it supposed to mean? They collaborated on many what?</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(S):1:2</i> - Remove "out" from the beginning of the sentence. "It is claimed" are weasel words.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(S):1:5</i> - The "(naturally)" is unneccesary and POV.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(S):1 - Be consistent with "McCartney/Lennon" or "McCartney - Lennon". Or if there is a differenc, don't make them sound the same.</i></li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):1:2</i> - Place a "The" before the "Beatles" (proper title). Also, place apostrophe to denote possession.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):1:3</i> - Specify "writing" as "song writing". Very long sentence...perhaps too long.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):2:1</i> - "It is now generally accepted" seems like weasel words.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):2</i> - Has nothing to do with him being a bassist (shouldn't be under 'bassist' section).</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):3:1</i> - What is the use and context of "mature" and "middle Beatles period"...needs more explaining.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(B):3</i> - Also has nothing to do with him being a bassist (shouldn't be under 'bassist' section).</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(OI)</i> - What is this section title supposed to mean. Doesn't seem to have anything to do with its contents.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(OI):1:1</i> - It doesn't help this article to know who <a href="/wiki/The_Family_Way" title="The Family Way">The Family Way</a> starred.</li>

<li><i>History(RIB)(OI):1:3</i> - Remove "he" after "these outside productions".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(OI):2:2</i> - Remove the dash and replace with a comma after "began an affair" and before "however".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(OI):2:6</i> - Place "Heather" after "Linda's daughter" and place commas around Heather. Be consistent with birthyears in parentheses...use "(Born 19xx)" or "(Born in 19xx)", but use the same throughout.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(OI):2:7</i> - Replace "would remain" with "remained" and remove "and devoted".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(EOTB):1:1</i> - Change the first "he" to "McCartney".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(EOTB):1:2</i> - Add a comma after "jeolousy".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(EOTB):1:3</i> - After "the public's interest in them", remove "was only".</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(EOTB):2:1</i> - Did Lennon leave "between" August and September? Was it August or September...it only takes one day to leave.</li>
<li><i>History(RIB)(EOTB):3</i> - Sentence should be merged into 2nd paragraph. A one sentence paragraph is not good.</li>
<li><i>History(ESC):1:2 - What is the meaning of "underwhelming" in this context?</i></li>

In any event, I added a link to one of the terms--<i>maggio drammatico</i>. Do you want additions to the list--dynamic and tempo markings such as <i>allegro</i>, <i>forte</i>, etc. etc.? 
</p><p>Also, the lead sentence might indicate that such terms are not just useful in the music of Italy, but elsewhere since it was and still is common to use Italian terms. Somewhere, a short list of common abbreviations might be useful; that is, <b>f</b> for <i>forte</i>, <b>p</b> for <i>piano</i>, <b>mf</b> for <i>mezzoforte</i>. An interesting point of trivia--for the sake of completeness--is that such abbreviations have by now been "foreignized"--that is, rendered un-Italian. For example, the abbreviation <b>pp</b> stands for <i>pianissimo</i>, grammatically a superlative in Italian, meaning "as soft as possible". You can't play any softer than that, yet Tschaikovsky has a section in the 6th symphony that is marked <b>pppppp</b>. Anything more than two is unpronouncable in Italian.

Italian-language music glossaries are as likely to list, for example, <i>a capella</i> under A as under C, as in <i>capella (coro a)</i>. In your case, all of the entries in the A section that have the preposition+article compound <i>alla</i>--<i>alla cepranese</i>, for example-- (<i>alla</i> means "like a" or "as a") could be listed by the noun, as well--C, in this case. Since the list is relatively short and since English-speakers (and many Italian speakers) are likely to look under A first, I suggest (with concurrence from two native sources) leaving the A section as is. It is not confusing or incorrect as it stands. It does leave you with the problem that an English-speaker might conclude that the whole noun is <i>alla cepranese</i>--as in "They're playing an alla cepranese" instead of, correctly, "They're playing a <i>cepranese</i>. I don't see a way around that problem unless you want to move those entries to their repsective letters and say something like  <i>cepranese, alla</i>: played in the manner of a <i>cepranese</i>, which is ackward. I think you can leave it the way it is. Another solution is to eliminate the compound altogether and simply list <i>cepranese</i>: a form of multi-part song in Lazio.  Those prep+article compounds are not necessary, to answer your question. Maybe that's the best solution of all. If you decide to do that, do not eliminate <i>alla</i> between terms--that is, in <i>canti alla stesa</i>, for example. That <i>alla</i> is different and is an integral part of the description of the term.</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd>On your list, check <i>alla'asprese</i>. It is almost certainly <i>all'asprese</i>; the apostrope is meant to stand for the first A. Also, Lazio is the Italian noun for the area. If it is accepted English to use geographical names as adjectives, leave it. If it isn't, I suggest saying "in Lazio"(instead of Latian, which might confuse readers. You correctly have Calabrian and Sardinian. Might as well be consistent.)</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd>"Addio padre" is the name of one particular song, I think, compposed in 1916 (during WW1). You have it as "A post-war political song," which makes it sound like a generic reference to many songs--a <i>type</i> of song-- after WW2.</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd>For consistency, if the Italian noun is singular, make the English singular; if plural, plural. That is: <i>ballo</i> is singular, so it should read "ballo di baraben: a ritual dance," and not "Ritual dances". See also under C.  <i>Canti</i> is plural and should be rendered as "songs" and not "song". <i>Canto</i> is the singular--song. The same with <i>canzone</i>. That's singular--song. Also, a <i>ciaramella</i> has a double-reed, not single. That is, it's a folk oboe, which is a double-reed instrument. <a href="/wiki/User:Jeffmatt" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 07:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

My pleasure. The more I think about it, the more I think the last solution is the best. That is, listing the name without the prep+article compound.  Cheers from Naples. <a href="/wiki/User:Jeffmatt" title="User:Jeffmatt">Jeffmatt</a> 12:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nice article. A few thoughts:
<ul><li>If possible, flesh out the Themes section a bit more - it seems a bit weak at the moment.</li>
<li>The characters section seems a bit overfull - all it really needs is a one or two line summary of the character, with everything else on the page for that character. e.g. the remark about Malcolm Reynolds being #18 in TV Guide's Greatest SciFi legends should only be present on <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Reynolds" title="Malcolm Reynolds">Malcolm Reynolds</a>, not this page.</li>
<li>It may be worth putting a one- or two-sentance summary for each of the episodes in the episodes table, similar to how the characters section is done.</li>
<li>The soundtrack "see also" link is to a redirect, and should probably be a "main article" link.</li>
<li>"In its October 3 review, Salon.com stated: ..." - what year? Also, the date wants to be wikilinked (e.g. <a href="/wiki/October_3" title="October 3">October 3</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" title="2002">2002</a>). In the same section, you've got a review comment which isn't in a box, unlike all the others.</li>
<li>Consider removing the external links from within the page, confining them to the end of the page. They're especially noticable in the reviews section.</li>
<li>You've got a few citation needed labels around - they need sorting out. (Specifically, at the end of the comics and film sections.)</li>
<li>A pet hate of mine is having IMDB, TV.com and official website links in both the infobox at the top of the page and the External Links section. I tend to prefer having them only in the infobox.</li>
<li>Note that all dates should be in the same form, e.g. 'January 2, 2006' (with appropriate linking). A lot of your references had the date in the format 2006-01-02, which doesn't display too nicely when you're not logged in/have no date preference set (the exception being the 'accessdate' in the cite templates, which requires the date in that format).

Pairs of sentences like "Settlers and refugees on the outlying worlds have relative freedom from the central government, but lack the amenities of the high-tech civilization that exist on the inner worlds. The captain of the crew of Serenity is Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the episode "Serenity" establishes that the Captain and his first mate Zoë (Gina Torres) are veteran "Browncoats" of the Unification War, a failed attempt by the outlying worlds to resist the Alliance's assertion of control." do not flow well at all.</li>
<li>The synopsis sections could better adhere to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WAF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WAF">WP:WAF</a>. Things like "Much of his and his crew's work consists of cargo runs or smuggling." could be changed to something like "Mal describes his work as 'Insert quote here' in a way that would be more informative.</li>
<li>Signature show elements... nothing about the dialogue?</li>
<li>The themes section is trying to come to a point, but reads as a disconnected set of trivia. Back up and use some quotes from Whedon and Minear about the overall theme, and then zoom in to specific examples. Right now it's got too many tangents - Fox's disapproval, Joss's favorite scenes, etc. But right now this feels like facts in search of a section.</li>
<li>Broadcast history is perhaps excessive. I don't think we need to have the episode order for every country the show aired in.</li>
<li>The success of the revival campaigns in getting the movie made should be discussed in the cancellation section.</li>
<li>Music should go after production, as it's an aspect of production.</li>
<li>Reception should go closer to cancellation, as they're related issues (Both being about how the public recieved the show, ultimately)</li>
<li>The reception section is too hagiographic - extended reviewer quotes, Fireflyseason2.com, Serenity Day, and the Stargate shout-out are probably all unnecessary, and only of fannish interest.</li>
<li>Awards, being a list, should be towards the end.</li>
<li>I cannot wrap my head around having the movie, which is clearly the most important spin-off, relegated after the books and comics. I'm not even sure the movie deserves to be called a spin-off - it seems rather more than that, and it seems to me like an expansion of the movie section would be reasonable - things like how it did and what plot threads it picked up on.</li></ul></s><s><p><a href="/wiki/User:Phil_Sandifer" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 14:53, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't reference this (or at least I'm not going to, this is only a quick review!) but I think you'll find that the progression from hunter gatherer to city dweller was much less linear and inevitable than the article describes. In the Middle East there was a lengthy period in which communities drifted back and forth between the two lifestyles before agriculture really kicked off. Some hunter gatherer societies reached levels of complexity equivalent to less complex agrarian ones - in the American North West, for example. You might do better to reflect this.</li>

As such, it should have many more inline citations, preferably academic. Preferably every single fact should be referenced - and currently we have entire sections with no reference at all (for example, 'Significance of community'). Notes and references should be merged, and if something is not an inline citation it is more of a 'further reading' then any reference. It's great that it already cites an important work like Putnam's <i><a href="/wiki/Bowling_Alone" title="Bowling Alone">Bowling Alone</a></i>, but it needs more important publications; there is not a single academic journal used in references as far as I can tell.

<li>I think this is an excellent article. Nice work! The only thing I found amiss were the image labels assocated with the image in the "Invasion" section. For some reason those appeared over the text section in my IE browser, rather than over the image. There are a few red links on the page, which may need to be addressed if this is take for FA. (But the page is definitely <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GA">GA quality</a>, IMO).

Two of the three issues raised, I predicted on the talk page, so they'll be addressed in no time.  I'm in the process of fixing the red links (by creating stubs).  I didn't upload the pictures, so I'm not au fait with their status; I think that the pictures of the Grand Duchesses will have to be Fair Use (they're only allowed under a non-commercial basis, although the Marie-Adélaïde one may be public domain, as it was taken before the First World War).</dd>
<dd>A pressing issue is that of the text links; using both Firefox and IE, the text links are in the right place for me (and that's for all resolutions and several different settings, too).  If any more people have trouble with it, I'll just change it to labels in the image; the only reason that the labels are overlaid is that I thought that it would be a neat way to help users come to grips with Luxembourgian geography. <a href="/wiki/User:Bastin8/Signature" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 18:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Luxembourg's Service Information et Presse (a government agency and the publishers of the pictures) have informed me that they aren't aware of any factors that might have released them into the public domain, and that they are unwilling to change their licence situation (i.e. non-commerial use only).  Since they can't qualify under Fair Use (because the topic isn't related closely enough), I've deleted them from the article and am looking for alternative pictures; I've contacted a few websites that offer alternatives, asking if they might allow free licensing of their images. <a href="/wiki/User:Bastin8/Signature" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 10:51, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><p>Since my last update, I've had no responses to my requests to webmasters, which is irritating.  A picture of Marie-Adélaïde would really be useful; she was an instrumental character to the political discord, relations with Germany, and the subsequent revolutions, and her youth (20 when the war broke out) ought to be emphasised.  Nonetheless, the article doesn't hang on such a picture, and there are many images already, so I think that it is acceptable as is.  Are there any more comments or criticisms to be made?

Was there a bill introduced in New York City, standardized tests that needed to be passed to move to the next grade, etc. You need to provide evidence that the practice is being used at elementary and middle school level.

If it were to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles/Nominations" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Good articles/Nominations">nominated for GA status</a>, (*hint*) I would be more than willing to pass it, as unless I am mistaken I fall within the realm of "haven't significantly contributed to" the article.</li></ul></s><s><ul><li>While I cannot address the specific things you brought up in your request, I have made a few minor tweaks to the article I felt were necessary.</li>
<li>I think the "Black September and PLO response" section might need some clarification. Namely, how is an attack on a Saudi embassy in Sudan, capturing US, Saudi, Jordanian, and Belgian citizens a retaliation to Israeli attacks? This seems to me to be an unrelated incident, rather than a response to Operation Wrath of God. The lack of citations for sources in this section is also bothersome. The sentence "only a seven year prison sentence" might be POV. While I myself agree that this was far too small a punishment for terrorism, I'm not sure this is outside the normal punishments of the time and place.</li>

Looking back now I'm in complete agreement over the problems with the "Black September and PLO response" section.  So far I've added several more attacks against Israeli targets that I had previously forgotten and tightened up the existing descriptions.  I have also trimmed the <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_diplomatic_assassinations" class="mw-redirect" title="Khartoum diplomatic assassinations">Khartoum diplomatic assassinations</a> summary to only a single sentence because it was only an indirect attack.  In the "Background and planning" section I created a link in the phrase <a href="/wiki/Munich_massacre#Aftermath" title="Munich massacre">released just months later</a>, which jumps to a page that has a slightly larger description of the Lufthansa hijacking with sources.  The sentence you marked for POV has also just been deleted from the section as part of the clarification.  I appreciate the suggestion for GA nomination, and will certainly do so once this peer review is over.--<a href="/wiki/User:Joshdboz" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 13:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><ol><li>Probably excessive use of the words "terrorists"/"terrorism" in Wikipedia's narrative voice, with absolutely no citation of who characterizes this as terrorism. Not that I disagree, just that (as you probably know) there has been much discussion about this at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a>, and the pretty broad consensus is that it is a POV word unless someone uses it about themselves (and of course few do). Not that it can't be there, but we should be very cautious about using it, and especially overusing, in Wikpidia's narrative voice. The problem isn't so much in a case like this; it's that there is no clean place to draw the line.</li>
<li>Any reason for linking years so often? Outside of birth &amp; death dates in biographies, MoS is generally against this unless the event looms so large as to be mentioned in the "year" article. At the same time, month-day-year dates here are often unlinked, whereas MoS encourages linking those to allow variable formatting.</li>
<li>"…outrage forced Golda Meir to…" is a bit vague and lacking agency. <i>Whose</i> outrage forced her to do this?</li>
<li>The "criticisms" section contains criticism only of assassination <i>of innocents</i>. Surely it should not be hard to find criticism of either the efficacy or ethics of assassination/"targetted killings" as a tactic even when used against "guilty" parties. Most of the "criticism" section is devoted to what is more a defense than a criticism (paraphrasing, Klein seems to be saying "they got the wrong guys, but that's OK").</li>
<li>"Using the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Avner, Aviv claimed in Jonas' book to have led a hit squad…": does this not mean to say something like "According to Jonas [and this preceding phrase may not be needed] Aviv claimed that, using the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Avner, he led a hit squad…" - <a href="/wiki/User:Jmabel" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmabel" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li></ol></s><s><p><br />
</p></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>Good points, I've tried to deal with each.</dd></dl>
<ol><li>The terrorist/terrorism issue is as you mentioned a tricky one.  I've tried to where I could change the word terrorist to an equivalent term in the specific context (militant, hijacker, etc.).  As of now I am keeping references to the perpetrators of the Munich massacre as "terrorists", a) because it is used throughout the article <a href="/wiki/Munich_massacre" title="Munich massacre">Munich massacre</a> and b) I think any objective observer, regardless of how justified he/she believes Black September was, would consider it an incident of terrorism.  Obviously my second point could be up for contention, and if more users disagree with the use of the term, I would be happy to change.</li>
<li>Years were linked somewhat haphazardly.  I believe that I've fixed it so only month-date-years are linked for variable formatting.</li>
<li>The statement now reads: "In the aftermath of the affair, international outrage over the mistaken murder forced Golda Meir to order the suspension of Operation Wrath of God." It is also sourced.</li>
<li>I have yet to work on the criticism section, mainly because I need to do some more research.  I'll add and adjust it as soon as possible.</li>
<li>I have tried to clarify the Avner/Aviv/Jonas debacle.  It now reads: "The 1984 book... by Canadian journalist George Jonas, purports to tell the story of the Israeli assassination squad from the viewpoint of a self-described former Mossad agent and leader of the squad, Avner.

<li>'Badminton is often compared to tennis' - 'contrasted' would be better here as that is what the rest of the paragraph does (although you have already compared the equipment in the preceding paragraph)</li>
<li>'The traditional scoring system in badminton history involves 15 points' - 'traditional' is fine, no need to add 'history', 'involves' is a strange choice.</li>
<li>'or called "setting".' - what?</li>
<li>'The pair will serve the shuttlecock like singles rules which base to their points' - what?</li>

You can use the standard abbreviations rather than spelling it out each time, and the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MOS">manual of style</a> recommends inserting an non-breaking space between values and units</li>
<li>'This system was abandoned later' and 'later also replaced' - surely there are dates for these.</li>
<li>'Badminton racquets, in conjunction with hockey sticks, are also used in the lesser-known “sport” of Bee-Whacking.' looks like subtle vandalism</li>

Examples of things to look for are <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AWW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AWW">weasel words</a> like "sometimes considered," clumsy wording like "apparently soon managed," overuse or redundant use of the word "also."</li>
<li>At one point there is a "--" that could be converted to a "—" (mdash). This form of punctuation is often misused, but I don't know the rules!</li>
<li>The images are great, but get a bit crowded in the area of the Cyrus Cylinder.</li>
<li>At one point there is a "citation needed" request which should be fulfilled if this article is headed for FA.</li>
<li>Usually links to other articles are not duplicated. For example there are several links to <a href="/wiki/Darius_the_Great" title="Darius the Great">Darius the Great</a> and its variations.</li>
<li>Usually an article is not placed both in a category and its subcategory. This article is in both "Category:Achaemenid dynasty" and "Category:Monarchs of Persia." Unless there is a compelling reason to do so, it should be in one or the other.</li></ul></dd>

I've gotten rid of anything I could find that was redundant or could be considered weasel words (with the exception of two "considered" statements which are attributed). I got rid of the Persepolis image, as it wasn't necessary. Now that section is much less crowded. I know the references section is unusual, but I think it's the best way to manage it; if there's a better solution, I'll gladly do it. <a href="/wiki/User:SG" title="User:SG">♠ SG</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SG" title="User talk:SG">→Talk</a> 17:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>A final suggestion. I think for FA status, the three references in the lead section need to be moved down into the appropriate sections within the main article. Also, it looks like the first note should be broken into two different notes because it is about two separate topics. If you make these changes, I am prepared to nominate it for Good Article status. <a href="/wiki/User:JonHarder" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a> 13:58, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Do they have to be moved? I can't really see it passing FA without the Cylinder refs being there. The line about the Cyrus Cylinder being called "the first declaration of human rights" is not accepted by everyone, so I had to source it. I've broken up the first ref, though. On another note, <a href="/wiki/Enceladus_(moon)" class="mw-redirect" title="Enceladus (moon)">Enceladus (moon)</a>, which was recently "Today's FA" a few days ago, has a ref in the opening paragraph &#8211; as does <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a>, from the day before. <a href="/wiki/User:SG" title="User:SG">♠ SG</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SG" title="User talk:SG">→Talk</a> 17:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Maybe I'm wrong; I thought they complained about that. My preference is still to see them moved down into the part of the text that expands on those particular topics. <a href="/wiki/User:JonHarder" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a> 18:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I see what you mean. I checked it out, and I couldn't find anything about it. The first reference  (Old Persian name) isn't noted anywhere else in the text, so I left it up there at the top. The two about the Cyrus Cylinder are left there to avoid an NPOV issue. I think I will leave it as is, but I will keep your note in mind. If the issue is raised in the GA or FA noms, it will only take a moment to change. What do you think about that plan? <a href="/wiki/User:SG" title="User:SG">♠ SG</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SG" title="User talk:SG">→Talk</a> 20:35, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I did more checking too, it is not guideline, but  <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Lead_section#Should_references_appear_in_the_lead-in.3F">this discussion</a> shows the various sides of the issue. My preference aligns with those that believe the lead material will be expanded farther down in the article and that is a better place to put the inline citations. I imagine there are cases where parts of the lead can't easily be expanded and it's redundant and clumsy just to repeat the same sentence in the main body. If the citation is moved down among the expanded material, there shouldn't be a NPOV problem. Anyway, that's my preference, but do what works for you and what you think is best for the article. It looks like leaving them in the lead should not get in the way of GA or FA. <a href="/wiki/User:JonHarder" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a> 21:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ah, after reading that discussion, I have to agree with you. It looks like a good idea to move it out of the lead. If anyone complains, I'll just tell them where to look for the ref and point them to that discussion.

Some points:
<ul><li>Per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CAPTION" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CAPTION">WP:CAPTION</a>, some FA reviewers' prefer that captions be complete sentences.  Take advantage of this to add information that reinforces your article.</li>
<li>"Several issues of Cyrus' early life are unclear: whether he was born in 576 BC or 590 BC, and whom he took for his wife."  That's two issues, not several, and I don't understand why Cyrus' wife is an issue of his early years.  Was it customary to be betrothed as a child?  If so, that should be made clear; if not, you should probably mention his wife later in the article.</li>
<li>"they further note his marriage to Princess Mandane of Media, a daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes, and Princess Aryenis of Lydia; Cyrus II was the result of this union."  It's not immediately clear that Cyrus II is Cyrus the Great.  Also... and I hesitate to write this... it rather sounds as though Cyrus was the product of a ménage à trois.  (Come to think of it, that would explain how Gilgamesh could be two-thirds god... but I digress.) &#160;;-)</li>
<li>The section called "Personal life" really isn't about his personal life.  How about "Dynastic history" or "Family history"?</li>
<li>The section called "Early life" really isn't about his early life.  How about "Legendary birth"?</li>
<li>"Arsames defected to Cyrus" doesn't sound right.  Who is he defecting from — himself?  How about "Arsames abdicated his rulership of Persia and pledged allegiance to Cyrus"?  Also, it's not clear whether Arsames' son Hystaspes became king in his stead, or whether Cyrus took control of Persia.  If the former, then how about ""Arsames relinquished rulership of Persia to his son Hystaspes and pledged allegiance to Cyrus.  Hystaspes' son, Darius, would later become Darius the Great, Shahanshah of Persia"?  If the latter, do we have any idea why a king would willingly hand over power, especially to someone not his own son?</li>
<li>"Several years later, when Astyages discovered that his grandson was still alive, he ordered that the son of Harpagus be beheaded and served to his father on a dinner platter. Harpagus, seeking vengeance, convinced Cyrus, who by then was living again with his noble and biological parents..."  This is confusing.  It's not clear at first that "the son of Harpagus" doesn't refer to the adopted Cyrus.  It's not clear whether this grisly order was carried out (we know there was legendary precedent for the king's orders being circumvented, after all).  The fact that Cyrus is now living with his noble parents again is a big, unexplained, unexpected jump in the story.  If these concerns simply reflect the ambiguity of the source material, that's fine, but there should be some way to organize this information into a more linear narrative.</li>
<li>The "Kings of Persia" section seems to shift between legend (third-hand reports with mythical elements) to documentable fact ("In 559 BC...") and back again, so that I'm unclear how much of this section is history and how much is myth.  Again, that may be an inherent difficulty with the source material, but try to give the reader some sense of which facts are considered reliable history.</li>
<li>"Cyrus led the Persians and his armies."  Were the armies not Persian?</li>
<li>"conquered the Median Empire in the sixth year of Nabonidus' rule."  This makes it seem as though Nabodinus were the ruler of Medes rather than Babylon.</li>
<li>Per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, section headers shouldn't include the title of the article.  You can probably make a case that "Cyrus cylinder" is a valid exception to this rule, but how about changing "Cyrus' wars" to "Military campaigns"?</li>
<li>"Cyrus defeated Nabonidus."  If you haven't yet mentioned that Nabodinus was ruler of Babylon, you should do so here.  The reader shouldn't have to click a blue link to know who he is and why he matters.</li>
<li>"(written before any new conquests could have been made other than Egypt),"  This parenthetical phrase impedes flow, is tricky to parse, and doesn't contribute to your main point.  Why not remove it?</li>
<li>The "Administration of the Empire" section is really too short to merit its own section.  Could it be combined with the following section as "Politics"?  That will also eliminate the problem of having the word "Cyrus" in a section header, which is against the MOS.  Better yet, move both of these sections into the "Legacy" section below.  You seem to be covering related material twice.</li>
<li>"Cyrus died in battle, but the Achaemenid empire was to reach its zenith long after his demise."  The second half of this sentence impedes flow and has nothing to do with the section topic, Cyrus' death.  I'm moving it to the "Legacy" section, unless you prefer otherwise.</li></ul></li></ul></s><s><p>Hope this is helpful! <a href="/wiki/User:Peirigill" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 01:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

As for the Nabonidus image, again, you're right; we do need a map, but there is only one map I've been able to find that shows the Achaemenid Empire during Cyrus' rule, and it lacks proper copyright information.

A few thoughts on your re-write:
</p></s><s><ul><li>"Faravahar, the symbol of Zoroastrianism, which influenced Cyrus to the extent that it became the non-imposing religion of Persia."  This isn't a complete sentence.  Also, I don't understand what "non-imposing religion" means. <br /><i><b>I've changed it, but, like with the map image, I'm really not sure what to replace the caption with. Any suggestions?</b></i></li>
<li>"Little is known of Cyrus' early years, as the sources detailing that part of his life are few, and many have been damaged or lost."  Seems contradictory: if there were <i>few</i> sources, how could <i>many</i> have been lost?  It's not clear to me whether there were never many sources to begin with, or whether many used to exist but only few are extant. <br /><i><b>Changed.</b></i></li>
<li>"According to most sources, he was born in either 576 BC or 590 BC."  Also ambiguous: do most sources give both dates, or do most sources say either one date or the other?  The simplest fix is simply "He was born in either 576 BC or 590 BC." <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"While Herodotus' description may be a legend, it does give insight into the figures surrounding Cyrus the Great's early life."  Is this really a separate paragraph? <br /><i><b>Moved.</b></i></li>
<li>"Like his predecessors before him."  <i>Before him</i> is redundant.</li>
<li>"Harpagus, seeking vengeance, convinced Cyrus to rally the Persian people, who were then in a state of vassalage to the Medes, to revolt, which occurred between 554 BC and 553 BC."  This flows awkwardly.  The phrase "to revolt" is especially jarring.  How about "Harpagus, seeking vengeance, convinced Cyrus to rally the Persian people to revolt against their feudal lords, the Medes.   This event, which is corroborated by other historical testimony, occurred between 554 BC and 553 BC."  I'm suggesting this additional clause to help distinguish between accepted fact and its legendary trappings; please revise it if it's inaccurate. <br /><i><b>I changed that paragraph a bit, so it should be more concise now.</b></i></li>
<li>"However, it is very likely that both Harpagus and Cyrus rebelled..." "Very likely" seems POV, unless the citation uses those words. How about "likely" instead of "very likely"?</li>
<li>"due to their dissatisfaction with Astyages' policies, rather than the story introduced by Herodotus."  Awkwardly worded; it certainly wasn't Herodotus' story that influenced them.  Can you find a way to say "rather than the events of the story as related by Herodotus" that isn't clumsy? <br /><i><b>Patched this up.</b></i></li>
<li>"Cyrus led his armies to capture Ecbatana, and effectively conquered the Median Empire."  Either remove the comma, or leave the comma but replace "and effectively conquered" with "effectively conquering." <br /><i><b>This suggestion was effectively conquered in 2006.</b></i></li>
<li>"The approximate extent of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus' rule, superimposed on modern borders. Persia became the largest empire the world had seen yet."  Can you make these both complete sentences?  Also, "had seen yet" trips me up; how about "had ever seen"? <br /><i><b>Changed "had seen yet," but I'm not sure how else to write the caption. Got any suggestions?</b></i></li>
<li>"Cyrus besieged Croesus in his capital, Sardes."  "His" is tricky here, since it could mean Cyrus' or Croesus' capital.  It's especially tricky because you've just said that the Lydians attacked the Achaemenid Empire, which implies that the fighting is happening on Cyrus' turf.  "The Lydian capital" is better, but not great, since that makes you repeat the word "Lydian" twice in quick succession.  Can you think of an alternative wording?<br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"Shortly before the final battle between the two rulers was to begin."  "Was to begin" is redundant.  Just say, "Shortly before the final battle between the two rulers, Harpagus advised Cyrus..." <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"And indeed, the Lydian cavalry became useless."  "And indeed" feels awkward to me.  "Became useless" is not strong.  How about "The strategy worked; the Lydian cavalry was routed"?</li>
<li>"the Lydian cavalry became useless and Cyrus defeated Croesus at Pterium, captured him, and occupied his capital at Sardis, conquering the Lydian kingdom in 546 BC."  Too much info in one sentence.  Split this into two sentences. <br /><i><b>Reworded and split; better now?</b></i></li>
<li>"Towards the end of September of 539 BC."  The repeated "of" might be a problem.  How about "In 539 BC, towards the end of September"? <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"defeated the Babylonians after a minor uprising by the citizens."  Is "by the citizens" redundant?  Who else would have been involved in an uprising? <br /><i><b>Good point.</b></i></li>
<li>"defeated the Babylonians after a minor uprising by the citizens. With Opis under their power, the Persians took control of the vast canal system of Babylonia."  Even if you remove "by the citizens," we have a problem with the word "their."  It's not clear until later in the sentence that "their" refers to the Persians rather than the citizens or the Babylonians.  I know, it's nitpicky, but this will be questioned in FA.  How about "Having conquered Opis"? <br /><i><b>How about "with Opis subjugated?"</b></i></li>
<li>"which he had not paid a visit to for several years."  "Which he had not visited for years" would be better. <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"and soon fled to Babylon, which he had not paid a visit to for several years. (new paragraph)  Two days later, on October 12, Gubaru's troops entered the capital, Babylon,"  How about telling us Babylon is the capital the first time it's mentioned, rather than the second? <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>I'm not sure about the wikilinks on dates like "October 12." <br /><i><b><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DATE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DATE">WP:DATE</a> says that you should link month+day, month+day+year, but not years or months alone (unless relevant).</b></i></li>
<li>"According to the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great, Cyrus' dominions must have comprised the largest empire the world had seen yet."  That phrase "had seen yet" is still tripping me up.  How about "had yet seen" or "had ever seen"? <br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"At the end of Cyrus' rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from Asia Minor and Judah in the west, as far as the Indus River in the east."  You've linked "from" to "as far as," and these don't really go together.  "From Asia Minor and Judah in the west to the Indus River in the east" is probably the simplest fix.<br /><i><b>Done.</b></i></li>
<li>"Cyrus Cylinder" is an apparent violation of WP:MOS for two reasons: only the first word should be capitalized, and the article title shouldn't appear in a section header.  I think this is a legitimate exception, but be prepared to defend this.  I'm still not convinced that the "Rise and rule" section shouldn't simply be renamed "Military campaigns," and the "Cyrus Cylinder" information be moved to the Politics subsection of the Legacy section. <br /><i><b>I don't think proper nouns apply to the heading rule. Regardless, I've moved it to "Politics" and renamed the section as you originally requested. However, I renamed it to "Rise and military campaigns," otherwise the TOC looks strange, jumping from his early life to his military campaigns. In all honesty, I prefer the way it was previously, but I think you're the better judge here.</b></i></li>
<li>"Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus to be found, and then dipped his head in blood to avenge the death of her son at his hands. (new paragraph)  He was buried in the city of Pasargadae,"  There's a small chance of confusion: was it Cyrus or Tomyris' son who was buried?  Safer to say "Cyrus was buried." <br /><i><b>Reworded.</b></i></li>
<li>"Cyrus was distinguished equally as a statesman and as a soldier. By pursuing a policy of generosity instead of repression, and by favoring local religions, he was able to make his newly conquered subjects into enthusiastic supporters. Due to the stong political infrastructure he created, the Achaemenid empire endured and prospered long after his demise."  This is POV unless citations are given, and even then, words like "distinguished," "generosity," "instead of repression," "enthusiastic," "strong," and "prospered" paint a one-sided picture.  Surely the man had some weaknesses or detractors?  A dissenting view doesn't need equal time or equal weight, but it should get some coverage. <br /><i><b>I've sourced it and thrown out a few words. If you can find a good dissenting view on Cyrus that can be sourced, I'd be grateful.</b></i></li>
<li>"Koresh (Hebrew for Cyrus) is a common name for streets in Israel and is a relatively common Israeli family name."  This needs a citation.  Also, try to eliminate the weasel wording of "relatively common."  Can you give a hard fact to back that up, like "1,500 Israeli families are named 'Koresh'"? <br /><i><b>I found a source for this statement, but the source doesn't back it up. (80% of all statistics are made up.)</b></i></li>
<li>The caption "Cyrus the Great allowing Hebrew pilgrims to return to and rebuild Jerusalem" is not a complete sentence. <br /><i><b>Changed, but I don't know if it's good enough.</b></i></li>
<li>"The Cyropaedia of Xenophon, based on the latter's knowledge of the Great King's upbringing, was an influential political treatise in ancient times, and again during the Renaissance."  The fact that the Cyropaedia existed might pass without a citation, but the claim that it was influential needs one. <br /><i><b>I've changed it to "admired" and gave it a source.</b></i></li>
<li>"The English philosopher Sir Thomas Browne named his 1658 discourse after the benevolent ruler. Entitled The Garden of Cyrus, it may well be a Royalist criticism upon the autocratic rule of Oliver Cromwell."  "Entitled The Garden of Cyrus" belongs more in the first sentence than the second one.  "It may well be" is a weasel word; is it or isn't it?  This claim needs a citation. <br /><i><b>I don't know why I kept that, it was in there since I began editing the article.</b></i></li>
<li>I'm not certain, but I think the references are supposed to be alphabetized. <br /><i><b>By title or author name? Originally they were sorted by print year, but now they're ordered by title.</b></i></li></ul></s><s><p>Nice job on the re-write.  I'm really nitpicking at this point.

Here are my problems and suggestions:</li></ul></s><s><ol><li>Comprehensiveness is not nearly there.  For comprehensive university articles, see FA's <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michigan_State_University" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Duke_University" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>.  For example, there should be a <b>Campus</b> section dedicated to the scenery and important facilities/buildings on campus.  I personally know very little about Puget Sound, but the one thing I have heard is that the campus is beautiful.</li>
<li>Reference format is not correct.  See above examples for proper techniques.</li>
<li>Article is under-referenced.  Excluding the <b>Notable Alumni</b> section, there are only 8 total references.  In particular, the lead (zero refs) and the <b>History</b> section (1 ref) are very under-referenced.  Every fact should have a citation.  I disagree with <a href="/wiki/User:JonHarder" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a> about merely moving the references from the lead.  Having them in both places would be more appropriate.  See current FA's for good techniques.</li>
<li>Organization issues.  Focus of article is not quite what it should be at times - it goes into too much depth in some areas, while neglecting others all together.  For example, <b>Tuition and finances</b> and <b>Fraternities and sororities</b> do not deserve their own sections.  Rather, a more appropriate way to deal with this would be to create a <b>Profile</b> section under <b>Academics</b> for the tuition/fin aid info.    <b>Traditions and events</b> and <b>Fraternities and sororities</b> should be under a <b>Student life</b> section.</li>
<li>Agree wholeheartedly with <a href="/wiki/User:JonHarder" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a>'s important suggestion about converting bullets to prose.  This is a must for FA's.  There should be very few (ideally, zero) bullet points in the article. In the <b>Athletics</b> section, instead of listing the sports in a bullet manner, they should be stated in prose (i.e. The University's 21 varsity sports teams include: Men's Baseball, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Crew (competes in the Northwest Collegiate Rowing Conference), Men's and Women's Cross Country, etc.).  This is just an example.  I personally think all the sports should not be listed.  The number is appropriate and particular sports that have been outstanding recently merit mentioning as well.  <b>Notable Alumni</b> should be converted to prose as well and needs to be expanded greatly.</li>
<li>One photo, which doesn't even provide a <b>fair use rationale</b>, is not nearly enough for an article of a college.</li>
<li>Prose is ok, but definitely not brilliant, one of the requirements for FA.  A thorough copyedit is in order.</li></ol></s><s><p>-<a href="/wiki/User:Bluedog423" title="User:Bluedog423">Bluedog423</a> 06:38, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

</p><p>Do you have a refernce for it killing insects? For it being a CNS stimulant? For its equivalency to guaranine and theine? . . . Generally I think you need to cite sources for such facts. Probably they are already in your extensive list of citations, but need to be correctly placed. Also increase  the peer-reviewed literature and decrease the web site references (sites come and go, journals/books are forever.) // Can you add something about the history of chocolate, perhaps a link to a page? // Decrease the repetition. For example, how many times do you say that coffee is the biggest source of caffeine? (I've hit 3 or 4 already; ditto for CNS stimulant). // What do you mean by "similar effect on children and adults?" in the "quantitative publication in food products" section? Please retitle this section and move it to after the discussion of C's effects.

</p></s><s><dl><dd>Oh dear. Nice work, but serious POV problems. Almost everything from the title down takes it for a fact that there is a bubble. There may be but even the article notes it's not possible to be sure until it's over. California and some other markets have existed for quite some time in a state where median home prices were well out of reach of median income. That doesn't mean CA is <i>not</i> a bubble, but it also doesn't mean that that situation in the rest of the country means there unequivocably is a bubble. It is possible that the US as a whole is not in housing bubble, and a number of economists do not paint it as one. I'm not saying it isn't a bubble, just that unequivocably claiming it is one is POV. Also the section 'Widespread belief that home prices never fall' with it's graph is misleading. The text talks about home prices not falling whereas the graph refers to median sales prices. The graph doesn't track the sales prices of specific houses and show they are falling, instead it looks at what sales have happened and what price they sold for. That graph is typically explained by a larger number of lower price houses selling and less higher price housses selling, and could occur even if not a single individual home price actually falls. Further, a bubble for a couple individual markets, even if confirmed, does not imply the entire country is in a bubble, which the article title does. So the article, including the title needs balance to take into account the possiblity it's not a bubble, and to objectively look at the US housing market. A lot of the same statistics and work could be there, just balance it with the other half of the coin. - <a href="/wiki/User:Taxman" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Taxman" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Taxman" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a>, thank you for your comments. I honestly don't believe that it's the case that the article takes the bubble as a fact—I would say that everything from the title down takes it for a fact that there <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> be a bubble, and presents facts and opinions that support both sides. The simple fact is that there appears to be much more evidence for the existence of a bubble, especially now that the market is cooling severely in many parts of the country (record inventory, falling prices, increased foreclosures, and the like), so there is a lot more facts and evidence to present on the pro- side than the anti- side, but that doesn't mean that the aticle is POV, any more than the article on <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> is POV because it doesn't treat <a href="/wiki/Creationism" title="Creationism">creationism</a> equally. None of this is to say that more anti- statistics could be added, I'm just not sure what statistics those would be. Also, when one speaks of falling home prices, one can mean many things: falling asking prices, falling price of mean and/or median sales price, etc. The graph simply presents one of these. For specific home, one can easily consult <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zillow.com">zillow.com</a> to find examples of homes purchased in the past few years that have resold for less now, but for an encyclopedic article, average values are much more important than specific ones. Finally, the article makes it abundantly clear that bubbles may exist in many parts of the U.S., but not necessarily the entire U.S. (see the <i><a href="/wiki/Fortune" class="mw-disambig" title="Fortune">Fortune</a></i> magazine "<a href="/wiki/US_housing_bubble#_note-Fortune_deadzone" class="mw-redirect" title="US housing bubble">Dead Zone/Danger Zone/Safe Haven</a>" citation).  <a href="/wiki/User:Frothy" title="User:Frothy">Frothy</a> 20:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm somewhat swayed by the greater evidence supports the greater coverage of the pro bubble view, though I haven't reviewed all the evidence myself enough to say. But the median sale price graph is still too misleading to be acceptable. The average person when they think of falling prices will never think of the median sale price across the whole market. Most people don't even know what median means or what it implies. Again, that graph could be explained just by what houses are selling, not by any sale price decline of any kind. That makes it misleading. - <a href="/wiki/User:Taxman" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Taxman" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Okay, but your comment about the plot of inflation adjusted year-over-year prices leaves me scratching my head. That's the metric everyone (RE industry and media, e.g., see this <a href="/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble#_note-15" title="United States housing bubble">note from the <i>Weekly Standard</i></a>) uses to gauge the market—what  else would you suggest? It was placed there to counter the common assertion that real estate doesn't fall—here's a clear, recent U.S. example where it has fallen. Also, this metric is also consistent with the plot based on the <i><a href="/wiki/Economist" title="Economist">Economist</a></i>’s data. What else can we use but year-over-year medians, which are much less susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Outliers" class="mw-redirect" title="Outliers">outliers</a> than the <a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">mean</a>?

<li>A thorough copyedit would be beneficial. For example, the ballpark did not lose the first event in April 2003, the team playing in it did. There are quite a few redundant words. If all uses of "additionally" were removed from the article, the meaning would not change.

It is my belief that -- since you obviously wanted advice so that you could finish construction of the article yourself -- that advice should be limited to such a demonstration. That being the case, I'll give you all my notes on the article, and hopefully you can use them while continuing to polish up the page. I've tried to implement several of these suggestions into my copyedits so that they can serve as a roadmap for how you proceed from here. If you would like additional advice after you've implemented these ideas, feel free to ask me to take another look. I'll be glad to.
</p><p>Here's my notes:
</p></s><s><ul><li>Watch out for redundancies. The lead introduced us to the company, and then most of the first paragraph in the "Information" section reiterated all we had been told. While people often will not read every section in an article, and the lead <i>is</i> supposed to act as a summary of sorts for the information present, the basic assumption to make when writing an article is that someone will read the lead and then a section. So if you're working on each section with the idea in mind that someone might not read the entire article, imagine that they read the lead and then they'll read the section you're currently working on. They'll only need introduction info once</li>
<li>Explain operations better to the uninitiated. Problem sentence: "<i>The West Liberty plant participates in the entire process by slaughtering, processing, and producing finished product, while the Sigourney plant focuses on the processing step only, and the Mount Pleasant plant only produces finished product.</i>" Now, you're not necessarily going to explain what all these terms mean or add parenthetical notations (that would be considered messy), but what you can do is use a replacement term that more readily identifies what you're trying to explain. Even though these words are the "proper" words to use in discussion of the subject matter, that could be a little confusing to someone with no familiarity with meat processing. So, if using "packing" could be substituted at one point, use that instead. To many people, "processing" and "producing" might sound synonomous, even though they're not in this context</li>
<li>Typically, you'll want to use as few words as possible so that sentences are crisp, while also trying to prevent any unnecessary pauses or full stops, so that things flow. Example: I changed "<i>While West Liberty Foods has grown and received awards since its creation, it initially faced a difficult market for turkeys. It has since experienced an episode of labor discontent among some employees</i>" to "<i>While West Liberty Foods has grown and received awards since its creation, it initially faced a difficult market for turkeys, and has since experienced an episode of labor discontent</i>". "Labor discontent" is, by context, associated with employees, so it isn't necessary to identify them in this sentence, and the pause at the end of the other sentence isn't necessary since both sentences are about issues the company has dealt with, and both can be mentioned in a single sentence without it being too long-winded. It's a difficult balance to find sometimes, but that's really what you want to shoot for: no unnecessary pauses, but no mouthfuls either</li>
<li>This kind of overlaps with the previous suggestion, but pay close attention to how you use commas and the word "and". Sometimes it might appear that things are being linked to things you might not intend for them to be, or it can make for run-on sentences. Example: "<i>The R&amp;D facility includes testing space for both raw and cooked product and can create test products from start to finish including initial formulation and final slicing and packaging</i>". Sentences like this can be a mouthful because they lack <i>proper</i> pausing. You wouldn't want to use a full stop here with a period, but you do want to implement a pause to display a change in train of thought. I change the sentence to read thus: "<i>The R&amp;D facility includes testing space for both raw and cooked product, and can create test products from start to finish, including initial formulation, final slicing, and packaging</i>". By the way, using the comma before the final "and" in this sentence wasn't necessary, but I did it because it seemed to be the style you prefer throughout the article. There's no correct or incorrect way of implementing a comma in those kinds of situations, but I think it would really look a little cleaner and maybe be less confusing to the reader if that final comma wasn't used. Me personally, I don't use commas in those situations most of the time so that the reader won't be expecting a pause where one might not really be needed. Typically, if you're just listing (ex: "I like dogs, pizza and lemonade") you won't need that final comma. If, however, you're using descriptions of each item after mentioning them, it's best to use the comma for clarity on the basis of description-to-subject (ex: "I like dogs, which are furry quadrupeds, pizza, which is a flat, oven-baked bread covered in cheese and tomato sauce, and lemonade, a beverage that is made from the juice of lemons")</li>
<li>You won't need the external link to the official site at the bottom. The company template box already has that taken care of</li>
<li>Watch out for the placement of links. They should occur where the terms in question are used first, except in the case of proper names. For instance, I've turned the second use of "Iowa" into a link to the article about the state, because the first use was in the title of the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative. I noticed a lot of links showing up when they should have been a line or two before, or much earlier in the article</li>
<li>Be sure proper capitalization is followed, even with words that are linked</li>
<li>In cases where you're going to use the name of something commonly abbreviated, use the full name first and then have the abbreviation follow in parentheses.

However, in addition to general opinions, I'd like to focus on the reference <i>system</i>. For instance, the DVD extras are not consistent; in one I have "Westmore, Michael. Interview conducted on..." and another, with multiple references, simply says "Source: Whatever DVD extra". How should I go about integrating these? I could change "References" to "Notes" and, after listing the DVD extras in the References section, put notes stating who the interviewee was and what date (which is included in all interviews). Alternately, we might simply genericize all the DVD extras, i.e. remove specifics about who and when the interview was. Simply put, I'm not sure how to tackle this.
</p><p>The other thing is in (what is currently) footnotes 9 and 15, two websites are listed in each note. Should these be changed to "formal" footnotes with "Last name, first name.

The casting information needs referencing, such as Dreyfuss thinking one of his own performances was terrible.  "The scene where Hooper discovers Ben Gardner's body" is mentioned but I wasn't sure who Ben Gardner is.  It might also benefit the reader to explain briefly what 100 Years... 100 Movies and 100 Years... 100 Thrills are.  I'd question "Reviews of the film were almost unanimously positive, evidenced by the 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes".  Rotten Tomatoes might be a good tool for contemporary movies, but with older stuff they don't usually have everything.  The note at the end of the criticism section that the shark looks fake and that its a widespread opinion needs a reference.  The Moby Dick stuff needs referencing too.

The film's actual box office gross was closer to $170 - 180 million or so, I believe.  The $85 million noted as <i>The Godfather'</i>s box office gross was actually that film's domestic rental performance, which means it made well over $100 million in ticket sales, also.

</p></s><s><ul><li>The article looks like it covers everything that needs to be mentioned and I feel I know a reasonable amount about the series now that I've read it. The article doesn't go into a lot of technical detail about anime, so I understood everything.</li>
<li>Needs references!</li>
<li>"very, very heavy" - Remove repeated word by replacing with something like "extremely"?</li>
<li>"runs Naota over with her Vespa" - Maybe put 'motor scooter' after the Vespa word to clarify what it is? Otherwise I think people will assume it's a car unless they look at the link.</li>
<li>"If you look" - The second person shouldn't be used in articles.</li>
<li>"June 4 of 2006" "August 5 2006" - Slightly different date formats in third paragraph of lead.</li>
<li>In the third paragraph, it doesn't really matter when it was announced and that date has gone now, so could it be written to say what happened? Maybe remove "On June 4 of 2006, it was announced that Adult Swim would run" and replace with "Adult Swim ran"</li>
<li>The story section seems focussed on the start of the story. How does it conclude? Perhaps the episode articles are there to provide that information, which is fine if that's the intention.</li>
<li>Needs an endspoiler template, or remove the first spoiler tag because the section is called "story", so people will assume that it contains plot details.</li>
<li>Would be good if all the character links went directly to their sections.</li>
<li>"it created a large horn" - I don't see this on any of the pictures, is it invisible or inside his head or...? I'm confused.</li>
<li>Articles shouldn't contain <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TRIVIA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TRIVIA">trivia</a> sections.</li>
<li>"In the same manga scene the Japanese version uses" - That confused me a bit. I barely understand what Anime is and I have no idea what Manga is. The problem here is my lack of knowledge on this subject, but I think it would be useful to at least make 'manga' a link.</li>

<li>"<i>Although Stone Age finds have been made locally, it is the Romans who first gave Maidstone some importance. Their road from Watling Street at Rochester to Hastings across the Weald passed through the site, and two villas have been discovered. They were also among the first to extract stone (the sandstone known as Kentish Rag) from the area.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>There have been two Army barracks in Maidstone. One is now closed. The present Invicta Barracks is home to the Royal Engineers 36 Engineer Regiment, which includes 2 Gurkha field squadrons.</i>"</li></ul></s><s><p>The article needs to be comprehensible, there is a statement in the article that says "<i><b>Maidstone’s town status was confirmed when, in 1549, it was incorporated.</b></i>" That should be refed, and explained. What does it mean that it was confirmed and incorporated? Things of that nature, remember many people of different cultures may read the article and they may not understand what that statement means. The lead section is on the short side and could do with expansion, it might be a good idea to merge the headline sections "Early history" and "Town Status" into the lead section of the article. <a href="/wiki/User:KnowledgeOfSelf" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">K</font><font color="#7D1B7E">O</font></a><font color="#6D7B8D">S</font> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:KnowledgeOfSelf" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a> 19:38, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

The later should probably be in a criticisms section for neutrality reasons. As I read it, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Gladio" title="Operation Gladio">Operation Gladio</a> was intended for clandestine operations if NATO members became occupied. There's a big difference between that and what is stated as "right wing terrorist organisations", so I think the reason for that wording needs to be clarified.

Gladio was (and perhaps is still) and integral part of NATO. In deed, it has been discovered (and published, see references) that NATO candidates were required to set up gladio networks before their membership would be accepted. These networks were then put under the control of the NATO leadership. Its an important aspect of NATO's purpose, so I don't think it should be under a critism section - it isn't a critism, its simply a fact. <a href="/wiki/User:Seabhcan" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 20:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Then most of that section is more appropriate for the history sections.

<dd>I can somewhat understand the purpose of a Gladio in the light of an anti-communist organization, given the rampant paranoia of the cold war period.

Also, there is no evidence that Gladio was every shut down but if we put it in the history section it implies that we know it was.
<dl><dd>The history section can just cover the history of the revelations regarding Gladio, as well as the current EU activities in that regard.

<dd>I do think you've made some good points about the section not being streamlined for inclusion under purpose.

<dl><dd>Yes, that works for me: having the "Purpose" section describe the existence of the Gladio and it's purpose--both as a clandestine organization to operate behind enemy lines and as an anti-communist group that employed terrorist and subversive tactics, up to and including coup attempts. &#8212; <a href="/wiki/User:RJHall" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:RJHall" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 15:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

</p><p>Probably more points than you hoped for, but here goes:
</p></s><s><ul><li>The biggest problem facing this article is a lack of references, with the only ones referring to recent signings. For information on what sort of thing should be referenced, see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Looking at <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a> or <a href="/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C." title="Manchester City F.C.">Manchester City F.C.</a> may also help with getting an idea of what to reference.</li>
<li>Merge the facts in the <i>Trivia</i> section elsewhere, or get rid of them.</li>
<li>The supporters section is biased. More or less all sets of fans would view themselves as "a passionate bunch". If it is so hard for visiting teams to score why was Everton's home defensive record worse than 13 teams (including relegated Birmingham) last season? Again some of this could be helped by references.</li>
<li>The transfer ins and outs are not needed, as Wikipedia is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">not a news service</a>.</li>
<li>There are many one sentence paragraphs, which breaks up the flow of the prose.</li>
<li>The staff list is unnecessarily long. Do we really need to know who coaches 6-12 year olds?</li>
<li>Consider moving the club records to <a href="/wiki/Everton_F.C._records" class="mw-redirect" title="Everton F.C. records">Everton F.C. records</a>, and leaving only major ones,(i.e. record overall goalscorer, record victory in any competition).</li>
<li>The prose could do with a thorough copyedit, and is a little too informal at times.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to list the reserve team or any player not issued with a squad number. In fact, some of those reserve players with articles may be candidates for deletion, if the guideline <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> is used.</li></ul></s><s><p>Hope this helps. <a href="/wiki/User:Oldelpaso" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 20:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
</p><p><br />
I agree with all of Oldelpaso's points, especially the ones on the trivia section, transfer in &amp; outs, the reserve squad and staff lists and a need to improve the tone. Some additional issues:
</p></s><s><ul><li>Intro could be a little longer, summarising main points of article.</li>
<li>History section is a little jumpy and disjointed; as there is a <a href="/wiki/History_of_Everton_F.C." title="History of Everton F.C.">History of Everton F.C.</a> article, this section should be a bit shorter and written in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SS">summary style</a>. At the moment, each of the three recent seasons is given a whole paragraph while some decades barely merit a single sentence - this should be more evenly balanced.</li>
<li>Avoid <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WEASEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WEASEL">weasel words</a>, such as:
<ul><li><i>The stress of an under-performing team was said to be a factor in Harry Catterick's poor health...</i></li>
<li><i>Fans contend that the 1980s Everton team would have gone on to win even more European silverware...</i></li>
<li><i>It was feared that the club's half-century stay...</i></li></ul></li>
<li>Remove the "Recent News" section - <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia is not a news service</a>. Consider setting up an Everton F.C. category in <a href="/wiki/Wikinews" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> and link to it in external links instead.</li>
<li>Split colours and badge sections, as they are more or less separate. 2006 badge April Fool mention should also be cut out.</li>
<li>Nickname could be put in a section of its own.</li>
<li><i>a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as being more respectful</i> - citation needed.</li>
<li><i>Everton fans are a very passionate bunch and have a reputation for being hard to face.</i> - needs clarification (there is the implication, though I am sure it is not intended, that Everton fans are violent) and citation.</li>
<li>It might be worth cutting out the abridged table of managers and just have a link to the main <a href="/wiki/List_of_Everton_F.C._managers" title="List of Everton F.C. managers">List of Everton F.C. managers</a> page.</li>
<li>List of shirt sponsors should either be moved into the colours section, and reformatted as a table.</li>
<li>What references there are should be properly formatted - see <a href="/wiki/Template:Cite_web" title="Template:Cite web">Template:Cite web</a></li>
<li>There should be book references as well as web ones. <a href="/wiki/User:Qwghlm" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 00:08, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></s><s><p><br />

<ul><li>Overall very nicely done and well illustrated. A few comments from one read through: I have never seen footnotes in an infobox - it makes it even longer. Why are they here and not with other notes in the reflist below? It might be helpful to have the map higher in the article - those not familiar with the geography of Scotland might appreciate this. Modern History seems a bit thin after the 17th century and Highland clearances. More on the Industrial Revolution perhaps? In the Administrative subdivisions section, these sentences repeat information from the preceding section on politics and seem unnecessary: <i>For the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom there are 59 constituencies.</i> In the Law section, does the last sentence need to be its own paragraph?

<dl><dd>Yes, I recognize this. I'm asking for assistance in what to cut out, if anything. I have read all the featured article novels, and used them as guides in writing this article. But there is a point where <i>TKaM</i> becomes its own article, apart from the others. Because of the far-reaching impact this book has had, that it is Harper Lee's only novel and she is somewhat enigmatic about it, and because the film and play are so closely related to the book, the lore involving the novel is extensive. Unlike the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, unfortunately, the subject doesn't lend itself into neater divisions as a trilogy does. --<a href="/wiki/User:Moni3" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moni3" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 18:38, 30 December 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

Much good work has been done since then. Here's my two-cents. Not for nothing, but I think that under 'Reception' both the impact on legal profession and race relation sections are places which should be trimmed. I think it would make more sense to place the impact on legal profession in the <a href="/wiki/Atticus_Finch" title="Atticus Finch">Atticus Finch</a> article, as 99% of it revolves around him. Also, include a link to Atticus under 'See also.' Furthermore, I would remove the impact on race relation section altogether. Although I hate to do this for 2 reasons. 1) It removes your hard work 2) Implies that I'm racially insensitive--I think that this is a tenuous connection anyhow. It states as much in the article:
</p></s><s><dl><dd>"The novel's release is so closely associated with the Civil Rights movement, many analyses of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them."</dd></dl></s><s><p>That's all for now.

</p></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, trimming parts to an article one has worked hard on to scour sources is difficult and I do it with some reservation. I will link to Atticus Finch - you are right to point that out. However, since the majority of written material on the novel is about Atticus in the legal profession, I thought it appropriate to give that material weight in the article. I have to think about that.</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>The second point is also difficult for me to consider. The novel's first impact was on race relations. Even though it is seen as a bit outdated for many in the field of race relations, in the context of its history, it was quite influential. I have to admit I don't understand your point about the tenuous connection. Are you saying it's not strong enough to be included in the article?</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>I appreciate your comments and feedback. --<a href="/wiki/User:Moni3" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moni3" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 03:45, 3 January 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Regarding Atticus, I think there is a certain point where one article becomes too long and needs to separate. I think this is normal and a good thing. Take for instance a honey bee hive, they get too big and one queen bee leaves the other with a bunch of other bees. When I read the legal profession section, all I see it being about is Atticus. This makes a fortunate breaking point as you can pretty much cut/paste it into the Atticus article. I wouldn't be surprised if someone at a later date makes Atticus a FA--he's certainly notable enough. Now in regards to the race relation and tenuous connection, first you place emphasis on the children in the movie. This almost seems as though it could go in the article on the film. I suppose my main argument with the tenuous nature of the material is that I have a problem with emphasizing an impact that isn't necessarily the main focus of the book. As far as I can tell Lee didn't write it as a civil rights movement book, per se. As noted above in the article, the gay community has found resonance in TKAM. However, just because a group finds resonance doesn't necessarily mean one must include a considerable section on it. Granted, this may be a weak argument on my part.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>One other section that I think you should take a second look at is the Style section. I'm typically not too big of a fan of the Style/Themes sections of articles on books, simply because I think they tend to read into aspects of the book way too far and are more interpretative. However, I think the Theme section is well done in this article and should be left. I think the style could be trimmed back. I'm not sure that sections devoted to irony, parody, satire, and legal allusions are needed. I think that if you cut these back it would be a good place to trim the article. Additionally, it would solve a little bit of the problem with that insanely large table of contents. One thing I would like to mention however is that I think it is good to keep that legal allusion with the opening quote. I think that is significant, albeit interpretative.

</p></s><s><dl><dd>Inline references on facts would be great (although I wouldn't envy the task after looking at the further reading list!)  There seem to be some inconsistencies in style within the article.  For instance, I see some mixed British and American spelling.  I agree that it's lacking in overarching organization.  For instance, the section "Shield and lozenge" seems misplaced.  I would put that discussion in the section that introduces the parts of the arms (where <a href="/w/index.php?title=File:Coatarms-labld.png&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="File:Coatarms-labld.png (page does not exist)"> Image:Coatarms-labld.png</a> is broken down).</dd>
<dd>Speaking of, that image's license seems to be in confusion.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=File:Coatarms_labld.jpg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="File:Coatarms labld.jpg (page does not exist)">Image:Coatarms labld.jpg</a> is marked GFDL, so I assume that the image itself was created by a Wikipedian and licensed as such, while the permission is for the use of the arms rather than the specific image.  Is that right?  If so that should be clarified on both images.</dd>
<dd>Basically, all the design elements of arms should be somehow grouped together under a unifying section.  I would break down the parts of arms <i>first</i>, before getting absorbed in the sheild (sticking to general -&gt; specific progression).  Especially since there are many references to supporters, crest&#160;!= arms, etc. scattered all over the place, you can save a lot of repetition by tackling those definitions early.  So my sections would look like something like this:
<ul><li>Elements in heraldry
<ul><li>Helm and crest</li>
<li>Motto</li>
<li>Supporters</li>
<li>Shields and lozenges
<ul><li>Divisions of the field</li>
<li>Charges</li>
<li>Marshalling</li>
<li>Ordinaries</li></ul></li>
<li>Tinctures</li></ul></li></ul></dd>
<dd>Where you put "national styles" and "origins and history" is up in the air.  The quote in the history section doesn't seem useful for the reader of a one page history of heraldry, especially when there's no other discussion of the split in heralidric law and what practical consequences it had.  I think "rights, wrongs and myths" does not belong so prominently placed in the article.</dd>
<dd>The external links seem well organized unti you get to the "other" links.  Clearly Burkes deserves a link, but what about a portugese article on Brazilian arms?  Surely that isn't vital to a general Heraldry article.  If a significant number of them really do need to stay, at least organize them more than just lumping under "other".  The "see also" list is also long enough to either be cut back to a quarter it's current size or organized thematically (surely since the New Zealand branch of the Heraldry Society is reachable from <a href="/wiki/The_Heraldry_Society" title="The Heraldry Society">The Heraldry Society</a> it's not particularly in need of an extra entry - or how relevant is a defunct American organization - or why is <a href="/wiki/UK_topics" class="mw-redirect" title="UK topics">UK topics</a> listed there??).  &#8212; <a href="/wiki/User:Laurascudder" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Laurascudder" title="User talk:Laurascudder">&#9742;</a> 14:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></s><s><ul><li>Automated suggestions are provided <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Automated#Heraldry" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Automated">here</a>, that you may wish to refer for some useful style guidelines. - <a href="/wiki/User:Mailer_diablo" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Dia</a><b><a href="/wiki/User:Mailer_diablo/B" title="User:Mailer diablo/B">b</a></b><a href="/wiki/User:Mailer_diablo" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Mailer diablo">lo</a> 17:23, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would love to read more about it, and the article could definitely go much deeper into the different issues in the future. In regards to your comments above about the history, it would be interesting to know why or if anything triggered the conceptual shift towards justice on a global level, and also if the different positions in the debate came all at once, or in response to one another, or a particular event.

I'm in two minds about the issue you raise, to be honest. On one hand, of course you're right that anglo-american insititutional philosophy doesn't have a monopoly on the idea of justice for the whole world. On the other, I'm concerned that the article will bloat out of all recognition or usefulness if it tries to cover every such idea, as well as duplicating a lot of material from elsewhere (some of which I point to in the 'See also' section). I did consider moving the whole thing to a new article called 'Global justice (philosophy)', but I tend to think that political philosophy shouldn't be completely separated from the immediate puzzles and worries that make it necessary. At the moment, my half-hearted solution is the first sentence: Global justice <i>is an issue in political philosophy</i>. Whether this'll do, I'm not sure.

<dl><dd>Sam, I faced a similar problem with <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind" title="Philosophy of mind">philosophy of mind</a> and the issue of <a href="/wiki/Systemic_bias" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> arises often on Wikipedia re philsophy articles. My general impression is that most people are satisfied to see some mention (a few sentences) of, e.g.,  how Hindu or Buddist views fit on the spectrum of the basic poistins that you are talking about. Something like, "the Chinese moral thinker X expressed a cosmopolitan position which slightly differed from this in 1078" with reference and so on. The point is to try to find examples of non-Western thinkers and sources that can be interpersed throughout the text and then work it into the existing text without bloating it. I'm not sure if this would work in the case of this article, but its just a suggestion.--<a href="/wiki/User:Lacatosias" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 09:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Yeah, I definately see your worries.  Moving to Global Justice (philosophy) wouldn't help because most of these are philosophy positions.  The Confucian line that the benevolent man loves all men, but loves them partially rather than impartially, is a direct response to Mohist critiques, and it works equally well against Utilitarians, and it was thought of as a philosophical position.

This article seems to be mainly about distributive justice, and the wikiarticle about Justice describes two other kinds.  Is the Global Justice philosophy you are writing about here only about distribution, or is this article unfinished?  If it's only about distribution, I think you should include that in your abstract.

</p></s><s><dl><dd>Hi, and thanks for your comments. 1. Distributive justice is one of the three central issues for the global justice debate (along with the scope of justice and institutions). The other kind of justice mentioned by <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">Justice</a> is retributive justice (not sure what the third kind you mention is), but there isn't really a separate debate about global retributive justice (to the extent that the issue is mentioned at all, it'd come under 'institutions' - international criminal courts etc.). 2. First person - the view of some active editors is that this should be avoided, but this isn't policy, to my knowledge. My view (expressed above) is that this is inappropriate for philosophical articles, because the appeal to what 'we' think is a useful tactic for exposing and challenging buried assumptions, and widely used in philosophy encyclopedias (I've just opened Honderich ed., <i>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</i> at random and found two examples).

And while it is 100% OK to use him as a source it would be nice if you could find a greater variety of sources.  Also I notice that you used a few blockquotes.  That is also fine, but consider some of the points made in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Quotations#When_to_use_quotations" title="Wikipedia:Quotations">Wikipedia:Quotations#When to use quotations</a>; perhaps prose would be better.

Let me go through them now:</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I too am uncomfortable with the fact that I end up relying so much on Solzhenitsyn, but unfortunately my hands are kind of tied on that. The uprising does not have much written about it in english and Solzhenitsyn's account is one of the only major things on it. Anecdotally, from my search of Google print I've found tens of books where the uprising is mentioned, but they almost all use Solzhenitsyn as their source as well. I found a few websites that have some information on the uprising, too, but a lot of it is really suspect and some of it impossible (claims about something happening years before it even could have). But I have also found a number of news articles or book reviews that are fairly authoritative and that I've tried to incorporate.  In any case, I was just now thinking of going to the talk page of the user that originally created the page based on a Ukranian-lanaguage book(s) and asking him to double check the article and correct whatever needs to be corrected.</li>
<li>Yes, the blockquotes are unusual and I'm not so sure about them. I do believe in using some of those quotes to help illustrate the point that is being made, but I don't really know wikipedia's policy on this and if the blockquotes that are there now are so apt.  I initially just started to use them to help kind of "break-up" the big blocks of text because there are so few images from gulags, and absolutely none from Kengir that I'm aware of. Should I use it more sparingly or not at all? I'd glady accomodate either.</li>
<li>haha, no it's all written by myself (except the sourced quotations, of course). Thats a vaguely flattering question, actually. I'm just in my summer off before school and I have a lot of time and energy. Also I felt bad that there was no article on it on wikipedia and felt like an obligation to make something.--<a href="/wiki/User:Clngre" title="User:Clngre">Clngre</a> 12:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></s><s><p>Hi, just a comment about images - the image there is fair use and I'm pretty sure that it would be an obstacle for being a FA.

<dd>- The Toronto Zoo is one of Scarborough's major attractions.  Too bad the image used in this article is of the zoo's admission booths.  I understand the problem, though -- I couldn't locate a better image here on in the Commons.  You may wish to consider posting over at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Toronto" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Toronto">Wikipedia:WikiProject Toronto</a> to see if anyone can upload some better images.</dd>
<dd>- I found the reference to Canada Post in the lead paragraph to be odd.  Such a trivial piece of information for the opening paragraph.  Moreover, it's hardly unique to Scarborough -- Canada Post quite often uses names of former municipalities (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Kanata" class="mw-disambig" title="Kanata">Kanata</a>) or even areas that were never separate municipalities (i.e <a href="/wiki/Downsview" title="Downsview">Downsview</a>) for postal addresses.  Since it's an administrative practice of Canada Post throughout the country, and has nothing to do with Scarborough per se, it seems unusual to give it such prominence in the article.  If the consensus is to retain the information in the lead paragraph, however, then thought should be given to rewording it because it is somewhat unclear (perhaps "..., and the name continues to be used for postal addresses.").</dd>
<dd>- The lead paragraph requires some indication of why Scarborough is notable or interesting.  Something like "Scarborough is known for its multicultural character, and is said to be the greenest and leafiest part of Toronto" (referencing information detailed later in the article).  Otherwhise, an opening para. that focuses solely on amalgamation and Scarborough's boundaries is somewhat bland. <a href="/wiki/User:Skeezix1000" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:27, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>-Okay, thanks for the tips.  As far as photos go, I agree it's not the best Zoo picture.  Getting good pictures is likely to be nontrivial, since the Zoo admission price isn't chump change.  I may have some old ones somewhere.  But that'll take time to address.</dd>
<dd>-I share your sentiment about the Canada post reference a bit.  I think it may be there more because it's unclear where else to put it - I would welcome suggestions. Perhaps it can be dropped altogether, but even though this doesn't make it unique to Canadian communities, it sheds light on an apparent elevated status of community that Scarborough gets - even if many others do to.</dd>
<dd>-As for the blandness of the opening, I will admit it has been left essentially untouched during the recent revisions of the articles, and could use some reworking.  Thanks</dd>

<li>especially given the glaring absence of her real name.  ("Vicca" sounds like a pseudonym, and surely she had a family name at some point.)</li>
<li>Her notability seems suspect to me.  The AVN Award, frankly, is the only really solid evidence of notability, IMO.  (The fact that her <i>films</i> are notable doesn't automatically mean that <i>she</i> is notable.)  This is part of a larger concern I have: there's really not that much material here.  What's the goal of this peer review?  GA status?  You're probably there.  FA status?  There's simply not enough material of note.</li>
<li>"...won the 2000 Hot d'Or as Best American Movie at the Cannes Film Festival."  This makes it sound as though the Hot d'Or is awarded by the Cannes Film Festival.  My understanding is that it is announced at the same time as the Cannes Film Festival, in order to capitalize on the CFF's media coverage, but is not affiliated with it.  This is like saying that Halle Berry proudly accepted her Razzie at the Academy Awards... technically true, but unacceptably misleading to anyone not familiar with the award. <a href="/wiki/User:Peirigill" title="User:Peirigill">Peirigill</a> 20:28, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li></ul></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>The goal is GA status at best.

<li>There's a faint air of fanboyism in the history section, especially in the discussion of Woz and his "design sensibility".</li>
<li>The history section says that "quirky and brilliant programmers" were the platform's "lifeblood" but the lead emphasizes the use of the Apple II by non-experts in business and education.

<li>There's not much coverage of the marketing of the Apple II. How, where, and to whom was it advertised? Did it ever ship with a monitor or other peripherals? Was the educational popularity propelled by discount pricing on the hardware? Etc.</li>
<li>On similar lines, the "Industry impact" section mentions that Apple II's were often bought just to run VisiCalc - what were the other options? How long was VisiCalc Apple II-only? Did Apple's later products really compete directly with the Apple II or were they targeting other markets?</li>

<li>"The Apple II's brilliant quirks served as a gauntlet that drew scores of equally quirky and brilliant programmers to the platform: these people became the Apple II's lifeblood."

<ul><li>Lead-in: what is "the ride"?  A Disneyland ride?  Generally I think the lead-in could be shortened -- some of the contents seem more suitable to the body of the article, such as the paragraph about his personal characteristics.  I don't know anything about this movie, and I think by the end of the lead-in I should know more than I do -- e.g. is Biff the hero?  A villain?  A minor character?  I think a brief note on the relevance to Thomas Wilson's career would be good, too; was this a breakthrough role for Wilson?  Or a minor role for a major actor?  Finally, it would be nice to get rid of that "spoiler warning" in the lead, but I'm not sure that that's possible for a fictional character.</li>
<li>Pre-Back to the Future: I'd use "grandmother" instead of "grandma" for an encyclopaedia article.  It would be good to cite sources for the deductions and so forth about the timeline of events in his life.  You currently have no footnotes; let me know if you need help formatting them -- they can be tricky.  You refer to draft scripts; have these been published?  If so it would be good to cite them, and even list them or point to another article about them.  This applies to the later sections too; I won't repeat it below.  An overall list of sources, in addition to the references, wouldn't hurt, as a separate section later in the article.  Where is Mason Street -- in Hill Valley?  You don't actually say that he still lives there.  I assume this is not a real street.</li>
<li>Back to the Future: After reading this, I understand Biff's role among the main characters.  I don't need a detailed plot synopsis earlier than this, but as I said above I think by the time I get here I should already know he's the villain (or perhaps could be described as the main oppositional character to the hero and his father).  I also think some explanation of "original timeline" is necessary; I've read enough sf to understand all the implications of this quickly, but a general reader may have read no sf.  You can link to an article with more details about time-travel paradoxes if you think that's appropriate, but at least a sentence of explanation about what's going on here is needed.</li></ul></dd>

<ul><li>The first thing I wanted to find out was what the expansion packs were called.  And I was surprised there were no sections dealing directly with this, instead having been mentioned in the plot or races sections.  I think a good thing would be to write a synopsis of the main plot of the game, then have a subsection on each of the main plots for the expansions (zilart/promathia/that new one) for example and then elaborate upon what these expansion packs bring.  (More detailed synopses of the expansions can be forked in their own articles).</li>
<li>Reviews are an absolute must and with a Japanese game link FF, it would be nice to have a japanese source too (like Famitsu).  Western sources will be very easy to find, pretty much every single gaming publication will have reviewed this.  Also make a mention of the expansion packs.</li>

It hurts my head to try to think of how to summarize the different storylines in the game, or try to boil them down to one overall summary.  I honestly wouldn't even know where to start.  I would be very afraid that any attempts to do so would resemble the mess that was the storyline section of <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a> before some very dedicated people cleaned it up, or that it would look like the crufty nightmare that <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_XI_characters" class="mw-redirect" title="List of Final Fantasy XI characters">List of Final Fantasy XI characters</a> is in places.  If we could hash out the relevant points to include and what to leave out, I'd be willing to take a stab at it, but as it is I almost find it easier to let the game setting speak for the storyline, as much of a cop-out as that is. -<a href="/wiki/User:RaCha%27ar" title="User:RaCha&#39;ar">RaCha&#39;ar</a> 21:43, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>One option you have is to work on it elsewhere (either a separate sandbox page or offline), and not insert it until you're happy with it.

<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> needs expanded.</li>
<li>Lacking a basic description of gameplay; assume a reader knows little about video games and nothing about MMO parlence.</li>
<li>The gameplay section has some strategy-esque statements in it. For example, "Once the player has attained level 18 on any job, he may complete a Support Job quest in either Selbina or Mhaura." The facts that it occurs specifically at level 18 and in two specific areas is of no real consequence.</li>
<li>The plot section seems rather weaselly; "a sense of individual heroism" is a rather subjective statement that ought to be cited.</li>
<li>The economy section contains some outright <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">original research</a>: "Hard figures are unknown, but it would not be far-fetched to assume that some (if not many) servers may have a GDP of well over a trillion Gil."?  Kill it with fire.</li>
<li>Ambiguous statements: It is not obvious whether PvP takes place "in the wild" or in specific set-aside areas. Similarly, I thought "engaging in successful battles with an enemy in a region" (national alleigance section) referred specifically to PvP. Also, "Depending on the rules set by the MC" -- What's an MC?</li>
<li>Three-sentence "music" section needs expanded or merged elsewhere.</li>
<li>"Ingame controversy" should be remade into a general-purpose reception/reviews/criticism section, and cite sources.

</p></s><s><ul><li>Well-presented considering it is a subtopic of Trotskyism and it must be hard not to recover aspects covered in other Trotskyism articles. It provides enough background for a novice without being too simple. Good referencing and neutral point-of-view writing. Certainly a lot closer to FA status than last time. Some comments:
<ul><li>Use of capitalisations (such as SWP,IEC,RCP and FI). I suggest you add the abbreviation in brackets after the full name before using it alone. For the SWP in particular it was used first as US SWP and I had to scroll up two sections to find out what it referred to. There are also sections later in the article where the abbreviations become somewhat overwhelming. Perhaps the occasional substitution with the full name (or when the reference is unmistakable 'the commitee' or 'the party') would make it more readable.</li>
<li>Too many redlinks</li>
<li>Still too little explanation about the previous Internationals (second doesn't appear, first mentioned in passing). I was looking for background like this at the beginning of the article.</li>
<li>Some style inconsistencies: U.S. vs US, first International v Fourth International,international v International.</li>
<li>The grouping of The Founding Congress and WWII seems a little strange, these could be split to make it flow better.</li>

All remaining capitalisations are now explained the *first* time they are used, and again if they not used for several sections.</li>
<li>Now I've worked through the capitalisations, there are even more red links - I noticed a couple of groups mentioned which were never linked!  Most of these shouldn't be too difficult to write articles on, so I'll work through them.</li>
<li>I've fixed the link for the Socialist International to point to the Second International.  The difficulty is that interaction between it (strictly, its successor, the Socialist International) and the Fourth International was limited, and the story of the link is historic, in particular lying in the WWI splits from it which mostly ended up in the Comintern.  Perhaps a brief mention in the intro and a section on communist concepts of an International would clarify this?</li>
<li>I've standardised to "U.S." in each case, and capitalised "International" when it refers to a specific International.  I don't think it would be appropriate to capitalise "first International"; the "Fourth International" termed itself as such; for obvious reasons, the International Workingmen's Association did not call itself the "First International"; rather, the idea of it being the first of a series of Internationals is a later concept.</li>

I've been trying to allocate time for a thorough review without luck yet, but here's what I see so far: 1) Some of the paragraphs are too short and have some choppy prose, adding up to poor flow in places. There's probably about 10 short paragraphs in that situation, I didn't check the prose in others. 2) The lead is much better but still needs more context. It still uses terms that you already need to know the material to know what they are. GPU, Third International, Comintern. It also doesn't say if they had any success or why they are the most important Trotkyist organization. It doesn't really tell us what their ideals were or what they tried to do, except a little through inference on what you tell us they were unsuccessful in. 3) The article's largely chronological structure makes it difficult to see at a glance the organization's impact, legacy, importance or lack thereof, etc. I would recommend shrinking down the chrono stuff to a reasonably small section to give a contextual overview, then use other broad sections to cover the various most important aspect of the organization. Are their views one and the same with Trotskyism, and would other groups agree with that? The Trotskyism section seems to be to only one giving overview of their views/goals.

</p><p>The section on money supply toward the end of the article should probably be moved to another article; it seems to dominate the article inappropriately, as this is more of a political policy discussion.
</p><p>There may need to be new sections added on the topic of money.  Perhaps a section titled the politics of money.  Or Money and Religion, or Religious teachings on money.  Or perhaps also the relation of banking to money, rather than just credit as money--which is discussed.  Such sections need to be handled carefully, as they are extremely hot topics, and the neutral point of view must be upheld.
</p><p>Although the discussion of usury in relation to money is now in the usury article, something probably needs to be said about how money and usury relate here in the article on money.

For an encyclopedia article, there should be a lot more focus on the relevance of the book.  Try to find information on how the book has influenced other books, how it was received, etc.  Ideally less than 10% (to pick an arbitrary amount) should be on the book itself.  After all, synopsizing and analysis are really a form of original research, which is generally discouraged here.

<li>"Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch like Dürer's or saw the original in Portugal." I rephrased this to make it clearer, but you'd better check I understood it correctly from the original.</li>
<li>"Only one copy of Burgkmair's image has survived, but Dürer's original single block print was copied many times." - there is no real connection between the two parts of the sentence. You should say whether many copies of Dürer's survive and/or whether Burgkmair's was copied at all.</li>
<li>"Non buelvo sin vencer" should be "No vuelvo sin vencer" in modern Spanish. I've been unable to  discover whether the original quote is correct as the motto or whether Bendini has misquoted it.</li>
<li>"where it today retains the name <i>Panzernashorn</i>." This is a bit of a non-sequitur. My German isn't up to much, but I assume that this has some intimate connection to Dürer's print?</li></ul></li></ul></s><s><dl><dd>Hope this helps. <a href="/wiki/User:Yomangani" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Yomangani" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>Many thanks casting your eyes over it.

<ul><li>That is not a quote - I wrote it based on the account given in Bedini.</li>
<li>I'm not sure whether the rhinoceros ever <i>wore</i> the collar - one was certainly created and sent with it.</li>
<li><i>impagliato</i> is (I understand) the Italian for "stuffed with straw"</li>
<li>If I could, I would explain the technique, but I have not seen an account.  I suspect the drawing was placed over the wood block and the design was pricked out.</li>
<li>Your rephrasing is fine.</li>
<li>There is only one original Burgkmair and one known derivative, a carving in a church in Minden.  I have no idea how may original 1515 Dürer printings survive; there were many printings afterwards, and a whole host of "knocked off" copies.  It and its derivatives are very well represented in a wide range of media.</li>
<li>The motto is correct - Bedini includes an illustration.</li>
<li><i>Panzernashorn</i> means something like "armoured rhinoceros".</li></ul></dd>

</p></s><s><dl><dd>Issues:  I'd replace the word "Movie" wherever it appears with the word "Film".  It's more professional-sounding.  The casting information needs referencing, such as Dreyfuss thinking one of his own performances was terrible.  "The scene where Hooper discovers Ben Gardner's body" is mentioned but I wasn't sure who Ben Gardner is.  It might also benefit the reader to explain briefly what 100 Years... 100 Movies and 100 Years... 100 Thrills are.  I'd question "Reviews of the film were almost unanimously positive, evidenced by the 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes".  Rotten Tomatoes might be a good tool for contemporary movies, but with older stuff they don't usually have everything.  The note at the end of the criticism section that the shark looks fake and that its a widespread opinion needs a reference.  The Moby Dick stuff needs referencing too.  Differences from the novel and sequel sections are listy.  If we must have a sequel section, I'd model it after those in FAs <a href="/wiki/Halloween_(film)" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween (film)</a> or <a href="/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead" title="Night of the Living Dead">Night of the Living Dead</a>.

</p></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd>I don't mean to quibble, but <i>Jaws</i> was actually the first movie to make over $100 million in <i>domestic rentals</i> (i.e., the amount returned to distributors from U.S. and Canadian theaters as the distributors' share of the box office take) versus simple <i>domestic grosses</i> (ticket sales).  The film's actual box office gross was closer to $170 - 180 million or so, I believe.  The $85 million noted as <i>The Godfather'</i>s box office gross was actually that film's domestic rental performance, which means it made well over $100 million in ticket sales, also.  Prior to 1993, <i><a href="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i>, the film industry standard publication, used to report strictly domestic rentals as a gauge of a movie's performance, and at the end of the year would print a listing of all titles that had made $1 million dollars and more returned to distributors during the previous 12 month period.  The magazine switched to listing box office grosses in 1993, presumably because everyone else by that time was doing so.   Anyway, I think the article should be changed to reflect this.   A good source of domestic rental/domestic gross information throughout the years is Michael Gebert's "The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards", but there should be plenty of other reliable sources that detail this info.<a href="/wiki/User:Hal_Raglan" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 03:12, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Oops, I forgot to add that both <i>Variety</i> (at the end of 1975) and Gebert's book (which provides data from <i>Variety</i> archives) noted that <i>Jaws</i> was the first film to make over $ 100 million in domestic rentals.<a href="/wiki/User:Hal_Raglan" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 03:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></s><s><p>Quibble this is not.
