<dl><dd>After e/c: same thing said above, but with more words:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Amish community, and those like them, are essentially farmers. They teach the skills they believe their children need to thrive in an Amish setting.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In very general terms, a minimum of a high school (or trade school/apprenticeship equivalent) education is required for most jobs offered by companies and promotions are unlikely without this minimum level. (Student part-time jobs are an exception.) I know of personal-fitness trainers without high school completion, for example, but with job-specific training. If you are creative and talented, you don't need high school to be a singer, dancer, visual artist, photographer etc., but you will need to be very, very good to rise above those who have both talent and schooling. General labourers in construction, office cleaning, agriculture and the like may not even need the local language, but will be limited to minimum wage or less.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>There may be jobs in small offices where, if you are numerate, "computerate" and/or literate, even without the pieces of paper, jobs may be available. You aren't likely to be first on the list, though, unless your wage demands are very limited. What you need, at base, are the skills you would have picked up in high school, even if you didn't finish the course. (Some jurisdictions allow "life experience" to count towards earning higher academic standing.)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Their lives might suck by some definitions, but there is a wide array of potential benefits for the permanently disabled. If the disability is so severe that work has become <i>impossible</i>, a couple of options are available. If the disability was suffered on the job, the individual may qualify for <a href="/wiki/Worker%27s_compensation" class="mw-redirect" title="Worker&#39;s compensation">worker's compensation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Disability_insurance" title="Disability insurance">disability insurance</a>, which may have been procured privately or provided by the employer. If the individual had been working for long enough prior to the disabling injury, he may qualify for very early retirement <a href="/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)#Disability" title="Social Security (United States)">under US Social Security</a>. Regardless of the source of the disability or job history of the disabled, if this individual has become a <a href="/wiki/Dependant" title="Dependant">dependant</a> of a family member, he may be able to get dependent health insurance, which may even be heavily discounted by the family member's employer. If the individual had already had health insurance, he will be able to keep it, provided he can still afford it. If the individual is having trouble affording health insurance, he may qualify for <a href="/wiki/Medicaid" title="Medicaid">medicaid</a>. And in the worst case scenario, emergency rooms are required to treat anyone who comes in with a genuine medical emergency, even if that person can't afford the bill.

<dl><dd>I for one would quite possibly be dead without it, so why not? Having said this, I didn't watch the ceremony, and it seems from what I can find out via Google that you are exaggerating a little. Anyway, if we are going to indulge in a little dubious patriotic boosting, there are worse things we could have chosen to base it on. A re-enactment of the Battle of Britain (or possibly Agincourt)? A celebration of a hundred years (or possibly a thousand) of football hooliganism? A celebration of Bus queues, and their antithesis, the drunken brawl as everyone scrambles to board the last bus home? Olympic opening ceremonies aren't supposed to be taken seriously. At least, I hope not... <a href="/wiki/User:AndyTheGrump" title="User:AndyTheGrump">AndyTheGrump</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AndyTheGrump" title="User talk:AndyTheGrump">talk</a>) 04:38, 28 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><small>(<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">OR</a> and personal thoughts)</small> A lot of the ceremony seemed to be aimed at making Britons proud of their country. In particular, the opening sequence with the singing of <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_(song)" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Jerusalem (song)">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flower_of_Scotland" title="Flower of Scotland">Flower of Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Danny_Boy" title="Danny Boy">Danny Boy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau" title="Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau">Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau</a> gave me goosebumps. There were also blink-and-you'll-miss-'em references to parts of our culture like <a href="/wiki/East_Enders" class="mw-redirect" title="East Enders">East Enders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grange_Hill" title="Grange Hill">Grange Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kes_(film)" title="Kes (film)">Kes</a> (most of which would mean nothing to someone who didn't spend a large amount of their childhood in the UK), and longer tributes to <a href="/wiki/HM_The_Queen" class="mw-redirect" title="HM The Queen">HM The Queen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson" title="Rowan Atkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir Tim Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> and <a href="/wiki/British_Industrial_Revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="British Industrial Revolution">the Industrial Revolution</a>. In this context, I think the celebration of the NHS was just a demonstration of something that most British people would agree is something that we can be proud of. It might be a rather clunky organisation, and absolutely not a perfect system, but we do enjoy the thought that anyone, regardless off who they are, what they do or what they've done, has the ability to receive the same level of healthcare as anyone else. So, to go back to the question, I don't think the point was that the NHS is 'so good' - it's that this is something that us Limeys are (possibly irrationally) rather proud of. If the opening ceremony had been in the US, maybe there would have been a section on something that the Americans are proud of yet seem incomprehensible to the rest of the world, like the <a href="/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States" title="Lobbying in the United States">system of lobbying</a>, or relaxed <a href="/wiki/Gun_control" title="Gun control">gun controls</a>.

<dl><dd>In perfect competition, the sales price will be just slightly more than the total production cost.  How much more is determined by the opportunity cost of producing that item.  That is, if the money to do so were invested elsewhere, how much would it earn&#160;?  If they can get a 10% annual return on investment elsewhere, then they would either get an average 10% profit in the current industry, or they would leave it.  There are some caveats, though, as leaving the industry may also cost money.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Quantity is a bit more iffy, but I wouldn't expect much overproduction.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You've got it backwards: in perfect competition, the firm is a price-taker not a price-setter! In the perfect competition model, firms end up pricing at minimum average cost because that's what competition drives prices down to, not because they consciously choose to set prices in that way. The model specifies that the goods are homogeneous, completely undifferentiated, so consumer purchase decision are based on price alone. Individual firms face infinite price elasticity of demand (if they raise prices even slightly above their competitors, they lose all their sales) even though elasticity of demand for their industry overall is finite. If firms are able to price and sell their goods in such a way they make a profit (economic profit, i.e. deducting opportunity costs - sometimes called a "supernormal" profit, rather than an accounting profit that doesn't deduct opportunity costs) then the rate of return to capital in that industry is higher than the average across all industries. Capital flows into that industry and more firms enter the market. Conversely if firms in the industry are making an economic loss (on paper they may be making an "accounting profit", but their capital could be making higher returns elsewhere - an opportunity cost), then firms will withdraw from the market as that capital is reallocated more efficiently. Equilibrium in the perfect competition model occurs when all firms make zero economic/supernormal profit - at this point, there is no incentive for firms to either enter or exit the market. The firms must produce at minimum average cost (the quantity produced by each firm will be the minimum efficient scale of the company's production function, the quantity produced in the industry is the minimum efficient scale times the number of firms, and is also the equilibrium quantity found by the intersection of supply and demand curves), and price at this cost, to record zero profit. No other price makes sense: obviously no firm can achieve a profit pricing goods below minimum average cost, but if firms try pricing above it, then competitors who produce at the efficient scale can undercut them by charging less and will completely eliminate their market share. <a href="/wiki/User:ManyQuestionsFewAnswers" title="User:ManyQuestionsFewAnswers">ManyQuestionsFewAnswers</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ManyQuestionsFewAnswers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:ManyQuestionsFewAnswers (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:16, 31 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I think he was speaking, though, and grammar in speech is generally a little less precise than in the written word and relies on context to make the meaning clear. If we quote a little more, he said: "the economy is rebalancing, with Britain now exporting more to the rest of the world than Europe." In the context of a balanced economy, it is clear that he's talking about Britain's exports being better balanced between Europe and the rest of the world. It's only ambiguous when taken out of context.

<dl><dd>Water soluble inks (like in felt pens) would be lost soon after such paper got wet, so would only be preserved in a waterproof container.  Most inks are not water soluble, however.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In that case, deterioration of the paper would be the next concern.  Bacterial action would be one mechanism, and having limited surface area, as in a tightly closed book, might limit that to the edges.  Leather pouches can also release <a href="/wiki/Tannin" title="Tannin">tannins</a>, and retard bacterial decomp of their contents for some time.  Then there are areas of the sea which have too little dissolved oxygen for animals and/or carbon dioxide for plants, so decomp is halted in that way.</dd></dl>

<p>Thanks for responses.  By the way, this question has been somewhat at the back of my mind since (I think) reading here at wikipedia of some notable author having died in a shipwreck and that certain complete or nearly complete writing not yet published had been lost along with her.  I would expect that permanent loss of written material would be mitigated against based a bit on the size of the craft, with currents and animal life having little effect on internal ship compartments for large vessels.<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/173.15.152.77" title="Special:Contributions/173.15.152.77">173.15.152.77</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:173.15.152.77" title="User talk:173.15.152.77">talk</a>) 12:23, 29 July 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I'd agree on currents, but not on animal life.  Any number of fish, worms, etc., would love to hide out in the interior compartments of a sunken ship, and might well try to eat the paper.

<dd>It's not just the difference in population that is significant - the desire to move to the US is going to me much less in Estonia than in Mexico. The US borders Mexico and has a large Hispanic population. If Mexicans want to move somewhere with better economic prospects, then the US is the obvious choice. For Estonians, the obvious choice is somewhere else in the EU, since they don't need any kind of visas or work permits, and they are much closer. While Estonia has about 1% the population of Mexico, I imagine it has much less than 1% the number of people that want to move to the US. --<a href="/wiki/User:Tango" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tango" title="User talk:Tango">talk</a>) 22:08, 28 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I have some relatives in Estonia, which is why I'm asking this question. They do not have Estonian citizenship due to the stringent requirements for citizenship there, especially for ethnic Russians (they are ethnic Russians). Thus, they cannot move to other EU countries and permanently live in those countries.

</p><p>Here's the article itself, but it might only be viewable for subscribers. Anyway, here's the relevant part:
</p><p>"Obtaining a green card means navigating one of the two principal ways of getting permanent legal status in the U.S.: family or specialized work. To apply for a green card on the basis of family, you need to be a spouse, parent, child or sibling of a citizen. (Green-card holders can petition only for their spouses or unmarried children.) Then it's time to get in line. For green-card seekers, the U.S. has a quota of about 25,000 green cards per country each year. That means Moldova (population: 3.5 million) gets the same number of green cards as Mexico (population: 112 million). The wait time depends on demand. If you're in Mexico, India, the Philippines or another nation with many applicants, expect a wait of years or even decades. (Right now, for example, the U.S. is considering Filipino siblings who applied in January 1989.)"

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I am not an expert, but I think the article is right. There's a total limit on how many green cards per country of births they issue each year.

The relation between political and military power is obvious: we call it "power" because of the wielder's ability to affect the world in some way.  The presence of the magnet does so as well.

The specific example I was thinking, is a single man who with a couple of years of education and nothing but thought and academic publication is able to alter history.  (e.g. inventing cheap household fusion, whatever).  But in fact he doesn't control what thoughts he has - he can only (e.g.) cause the world to have a cheap fusion plant in each house (just because it's so darn easy and useful), he's not a businessman and can't do anything but publish.  So he can change 7 billion people's lives pretty dramatically (due to what household items are possible with free electricity) OR he can not publish and then not even get tenure.
