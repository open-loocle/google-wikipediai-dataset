<p>The L.A.

Does anyone know of an uncensored link to the video (in other words, the reporters' live commentary)?

<dl><dd>That audio is not present on any of the YooToob versions I found. Therefore, given the masses of diligent YooToob feeders, I think it's safe to assume (1) the audio was never recorded, or (2) the audio was removed or lost before the video was broadcast or otherwise escaped from the TV station (was this live?). "Uncensored" assumes too much considering the number of other ways the audio could be lost, including various technical problems. &#8213;<a href="/wiki/User:Mandruss" title="User:Mandruss"><span style="color:#775C57;"><i><b>Mandruss</b></i></span></a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mandruss" title="User talk:Mandruss"><span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span></a> 05:38, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for looking, I spent a good twenty minutes at it.  It's quite blatantly an editorial decision, the coincidence with the violence was far too obvious, and the reporter says nothing about the sound going out when she comments in a follow-up piece where she is 'interviewed' by her co-workers.  This will perhaps be leaked or be admitted as evidence in the officers' state assault and federal civil rights trial, at which point it will be subject to a freedom of information act inquiry. I'll keep looking. <a href="/wiki/User:Medeis" title="User:Medeis">μηδείς</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Medeis" title="User talk:Medeis">talk</a>) 05:50, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>If it was an editorial decision, it was a good one. Her inane play-by-play commentary — <i>Suspect being Tased! Suspect being Tased!</i> — added nothing useful and, in Wikipedia lingo, was original research. What followed very well might have sounded too biased for the station to broadcast; viewers can clearly see what was happening and make their own interpretations. Actually I'm curious why you're interested in that commentary. &#8213;<a href="/wiki/User:Mandruss" title="User:Mandruss"><span style="color:#775C57;"><i><b>Mandruss</b></i></span></a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mandruss" title="User talk:Mandruss"><span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span></a> 05:55, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I see you don't deny this was censored on purpose.  I am interested in it precisely because it was censored.  Excited utterances and the recorded speech of eyewitnesses have special import in US courts, although given the video exists a judge might exclude the commentary as unnecessary if it was prejudicial.  In any case, the "reasonable person" standard holds, and this broadcaster is presumably a seasoned reporter.  As for bias, are we supposed to believe she started off, "Yeah, <i>kick</i> that motherfucker!  Don't just beat him, shoot him in the head!  Ooh, this violence arouses me," or did mean something else?  We most certainly would not exclude such verbatim speech from being posted if it were verified.  I am asking no more.  Are there reliable sources that give the unedited cut? <a href="/wiki/User:Medeis" title="User:Medeis">μηδείς</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Medeis" title="User talk:Medeis">talk</a>) 07:47, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><i>Note:</i> It's debatable which is more inflammatory, the thread or the hat. In any case, a hatter should identify themselves, especially in borderline cases. Why should it be necessary to find the edit in the history in order to establish that I didn't do it because I didn't like Medeis's comment? The mad hatter were: 117.173.108.206. &#8213;<a href="/wiki/User:Mandruss" title="User:Mandruss"><span style="color:#775C57;"><i><b>Mandruss</b></i></span></a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mandruss" title="User talk:Mandruss"><span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span></a> 13:16, 10 April 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<ul><li>Given that the video was shot by the very TV station that released it with the audio-commentary partially cut-off there are unlikely to be any other versions available with the commentary unless such a version is (1) leaked, or (2) released by the media organization, or as part of legal proceedings, sometime down the line. <a href="/wiki/User:Abecedare" title="User:Abecedare">Abecedare</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Abecedare" title="User talk:Abecedare">talk</a>) 16:13, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Assuming a patient went to their doctor with a physical problem, but the doctor noticed something wrong with the patients mental health. What criteria or threshold of behaviour would cause the doctor to make a referral to the mental health services? Is there a checklist of "signs and symptoms" a doctor looks for in their patients? For example, if the patient expresses paranoid thoughts to the doctor, will that generate a referral? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:NHSdoctors&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:NHSdoctors (page does not exist)">NHSdoctors</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NHSdoctors&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:NHSdoctors (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:30, 10 April 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The term mental health, just like physical health, covers a large number of potential conditions. There is no universal checklist. A GP's course of action depends on the symptoms displayed and their own professional judgement. <a href="/wiki/User:Dalliance" title="User:Dalliance">Dalliance</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dalliance" title="User talk:Dalliance">talk</a>) 12:02, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is entirely possible for you to ask your GP about this. He or she will be more than willing to explain - that is part of their job. <span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml"><font face="MV Boli" color="blue"><a href="/wiki/User:KageTora" title="User:KageTora">KägeTorä - (<sup>影</sup><sub>虎</sub>)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KageTora" title="User talk:KageTora">もしもし！</a>)</font></span> 13:09, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Today, in 2015 the mental health resource in the UK are under such strain, that to refer even just a third of  patients with a mental health issue would make the system collapse entirely. Thus the  threshold (in practice)  is were the  GP believe their patient is close to endangering the lives of others. Should they not refer such a patient and that patent causes death of another (<i>and very, very few do – compared with the rest of the 'normal' mentally sane population</i>), the GP knows they may have to come up before a  <a href="/wiki/GMC" class="mw-disambig" title="GMC">GMC</a> inquiry for negligence. For everyone else, they just proscribe pills and <a href="/wiki/Platitude" title="Platitude">platitudes</a>. Shame, because Britain was one of the pioneers of effective health  treatment that returned such people, back into society so that they could become productive citizen once more. In these modern days of automation – there is no shortage of labour – so the same need doesn't exist to treat effectively. So the current criteria is: “<i>Is this patent potentially dangerous enough to bump he/her up the priority list and get him some proper treatment?</i>” Oh, No. A doctor will not explain this to a patient or relative because their patent or relative is desperate and begging for effective help and could cause a very emotionally difficult consultation for the GP - (<i>GP's have feeling and a sense of empathy towards their patients too</i>) but their hands are tied now as to what help they can provide. --<a href="/wiki/User:Aspro" title="User:Aspro">Aspro</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aspro" title="User talk:Aspro">talk</a>) 13:27, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>It's not just the doctor who might notice something wrong with the patient's mental health.   Patients themselves understand when they are mentally ill and there are emergency mental health services which they can contact.   This area has some of the best mental health provision in the country.   A patient can walk into A&amp;E and if necessary a doctor will liaise with the staff in the mental health unit which is next door and the patient can be admitted the same day.   There are area mental health units which a patient can visit and the central unit has a crisis contact point accessible directly from the street which can be visited or telephoned 24 hours a day. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/87.81.147.76" title="Special:Contributions/87.81.147.76">87.81.147.76</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:87.81.147.76" title="User talk:87.81.147.76">talk</a>) 14:37, 10 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I cannot go along with Aspro's comments. Whether there is strain on the system or not should not influence the doctor's or your opinion about the need for referral to the mental health services. Services grow (or should grow) depending on the demand for that service within the population. If there are reduced referrals because someone foolishly thinks that they may cause strain on the system or there might be a long wait to be seen is doing society an injustice and doing the Department of Health a favour - not to mention the patient. What happened recently when emergency departments were overwhelmed with patients? the government found a few  million pounds to alleviate the problem. A more pertinent cause of the reduced budget and general service shortfall in mental health services in the UK is the lack of political clout that the service and its managers have. Compare cancer or childrens' illness with mental health and most people will prefer to support the former two. This is largely due to the stigma that still attaches to mental health disorders and the appalling ignorance on the part of politicians and the public about mental illness.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li>I agree that it <i>should not influence the doctor's or your opinion</i> but when the mental health infrastructure has been cut to the bone to only admit emergences what option has the GP got but to hope for the best and offer platitudes and drugs. This links into 87.81.147.76  comment. Yeah, they might be able to walk in to any A&amp;E  but until recently I did volunteer work for a mental heath charity and if they walk in they were told to see their GP until the problem became so bad that the police delivered them to to hospital – in the back of a van in a <i>cage</i>. <small>If you got taken to hospital in a cage would, that do yourself esteem any good or would it make your feel even more retched than you already felt?</small> Only then did they get admitted, because they were becoming a danger not only to themselves but other and so law enforcement had to take over. So instead of nipping the problem in the bud at the start, there are now legal issues, complex social problems that social workers are now expected to unpick, etc. etc. Britain used to be a great naval nation and they knew the meaning of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/spoil+the+ship+for+a+hapworth+of+tar.html">Spoil the ship for a ha'pworth of tar</a>If the brakes on your car start to fail, do you say to yourself “<i>oh well Im going to sell it soon so I will leave the next owner to fix them.</i>” The NHS now does not wait for people to get lung cancer, it actively promotes the cessation of smoking. Why is mental health now become different over the last decades? Four  out of ten experience mental health problems at sometime in there lives and it is an eye- opener to console weeping police officers, executives, etc.  that have found themselves admitted and bewail  <i>“but I  should not  be here! I cant be in a mental ward. These places are for the hoi-poli. I am different”</i>. It is such a shock to them, that the initial response is one of absolute and total denial. Mental illness can hit anybody out of the blue and the pills that their GP's gave them was no substitute to avoid  the eventual crisis. <small> Today a 'crisis' now mean that things have got to a stage that their wives <i>out of fear</i> have got a court order to prevent them seeing their children and there careers ends in tatters.

<dd>In the UK, we have secure mental health units all over the country for patients which have indeed expressed mental health issues. If a GP is concerned about whether the patient will be an immediate danger to others or him/herself, then the GP will refer that patient first to A&amp;E, where the patient will be once again assessed, then referred to the actual mental health unit (whichever one has a bed available at the time), then assessed once again there, usually upon arrival. They try to get patients into units which are closest to their next-of-kin, but this does not always happen. Patients are then given medication to deal with their problems (<a href="/wiki/Librium" class="mw-redirect" title="Librium">librium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thiamine" title="Thiamine">thiamine</a>, and Vitamin B+, to deal with any substance abuse issues which may have caused the mental problems), and optionally sleeping tablets. Some are given <a href="/wiki/Lithium" title="Lithium">lithium</a> to deal with mood swings. They are re-assessed twice weekly, with the aim of getting them well as soon as possible, as, unfortunately, the NHS needs the beds. <span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml"><font face="MV Boli" color="blue"><a href="/wiki/User:KageTora" title="User:KageTora">KägeTorä - (<sup>影</sup><sub>虎</sub>)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KageTora" title="User talk:KageTora">もしもし！</a>)</font></span> 13:54, 11 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>It's normally better to try and talk the patient round to it, first.  Same as any illness, you can't treat it unless the patient is persuaded they need help.  Criminals can't be rehabilitated unless they admit guilt.  Lack of awareness is a problem, so they might not know they have a problem, but be open to it being addressed. 
</p><p>I have mental health issues, but I got simple disrespect and bad customer service from several NHS psychiatrists. I no longer trust them.  I asked the GP to be referred (against his objections) to a private psychiatrist in Ireland - at my own cost, and hassle.  I am recovering, but it is only because I trust her to treat me.  I still would not consider it being done locally, and I still see the NHS as Skynet.  If the GP referred me to anyone without my knowledge, it would have been very, very hurtful.
</p><p>It also depends on the doctor and patient, and your interpretation of 'paranoid thought'.  Doctors have the power to detain a patient for their mental health; but normally that would be overkill.  It is almost always better to do so in the community - de-institutionalisation is the theme in <i>The Rain Man</i>.  For hospitals, it varies: the State Hospital in Lanarkshire is a top security hospital for dangerous patients, eg. who have killed someone.  Most detained patients are in lower security; and many are not secure at all.  I formerly worked at a mental hospital where, if a patient absconded, they didn't do much.  --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Crazy_Aberdeen_Guy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Crazy Aberdeen Guy (page does not exist)">Crazy Aberdeen Guy</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crazy_Aberdeen_Guy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Crazy Aberdeen Guy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:35, 12 April 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That is a studio headshot. She did not work in a studio in Ireland. She started in London. She moved to Hollywood.

<dl><dd>As I said, "there is an argument that the term 'dinosaur' is unscientific..." the argument, and the reasoning behind it, tells the reader much about how science (or at least biology) classifies things. That science still manages to have rational discussions about 'trees' or 'marine mammals' suggests that the argument hasn't necessarily been won - and probably suggests that when it comes to classifying things, pragmatism isn't of itself unscientific. Accordingly, one can have a rational scientific discussion about 'big herbivorous dinosaur whit long neck', as long as one makes clear that one is using the classification for a specific purpose, and that one isn't necessarily implying any particular evolutionary relationship. Classification in of itself is neither inherently scientific or non-scientific - the distinction is more a question of what is implied by the classification. <a href="/wiki/User:AndyTheGrump" title="User:AndyTheGrump">AndyTheGrump</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AndyTheGrump" title="User talk:AndyTheGrump">talk</a>)
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Indeed. <a href="/wiki/Tree" title="Tree">Tree</a> is a good example. Definitely not a good formal grouping, nor a clade, but also certainly it <i>is</i> a useful group, and we'd be silly to try to avoid it. We of course <i>do</i> have dinosaurs flying through our yards if we take the term to mean the clade (as many paleontologists do); that's why "non-avian dinosaur" is a common term in the literature. <a href="/wiki/User:SemanticMantis" title="User:SemanticMantis">SemanticMantis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:SemanticMantis" title="User talk:SemanticMantis">talk</a>) 20:30, 10 April 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That's entirely true.

It seems the majority of foods we call berries aren't actually botanical berries, while lots of things we'd never classify as berries should still be classified as such).  The thing is, context matters.  What makes sense to a biologist may not to a cook.  Or as someone wiser than me once said "Knowledge will tell you a tomato is a fruit.

<dl><dd>Another good one is "bug" - which most people would use for insects, spiders, butterflies and a bunch of other things.  It's useful to have generic words for things in order to avoid having to do a detailed classification when time is of the essence.  "&lt;scream&gt; Steve, there's a huge bug in the bathtub!"...is a sufficiently precise form of communication.  In this context, there is no need to count six legs but not count pseudo-legs and look for the segmented body plan in order to use the unnecessarily precise term: "insect".  The same thing is true for words like "dinosaur".  We may want to say things like "When dinosaurs ruled the Earth" as a convenient short-hand.  Excessive precision is often counter-productive - a classic example being the ridiculous argument about whether Pluto is a planet or not.  If your robotic lander is in orbit around the thing, you'll probably want to say things like "Let's land on the planet now" without having to pick a more scientifically precise term when ambiguity is simply not an issue.  We do this all the time...if I ask you whether a pickup truck is a car - you'll probably say "No" - but if I ask you to count the number of cars ahead of us in the drive-thru lane, I bet you'd include pickup trucks in the count.  Informal language is stuffed full of that kind of mess...which is actually a good thing when rapid, approximate communication is needed.  The important thing is to use more precise language where it actually matters - and to know when to mentally flip between modes. <a href="/wiki/User:SteveBaker" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:SteveBaker" title="User talk:SteveBaker">talk</a>) 13:31, 12 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Seriously, we're actually having this argument on a factual site? We're actually supposed to pretend religion is normal? Once again, the reality is that I'm right, and I know. Religion is incompatible with the laws of physics, therefore it doesn't exist. How hard can it be? I know years of indoctrination are hard to shed, and that when you're living in a state that is basically a fundamentalist theocratical state, like the US, it may be hard to express rational thought, but this is reality.

You said "As for the OP, those people are either lying or mentally ill".  That's what I've taken exception to.  You can prove that something exists, by giving evidence of it.  But how can you prove that something does not exist?  And be so hard-line about it?  The record of science is a long litany of things that were said, categorically, just like you're doing now, not to exist, only for their existence to be later proven.  I'm not saying I believe in succubi, but neither do I dismiss multiple claims over many centuries as manifestations of mental illness or as lies.  I maintain an open mind.

<dd>Religion is something that has been ubiquitious in humanity since the dawn of history, and almost certainly much longer.  No matter how much you or I dislike it, it cannot in any way be described as not being "normal".  (And religion clearly does exist, even if some of its claims are false or nonsense).  Additionally, while I'm not a qualified psychiatrist, I am not aware that "believing in something that isn't actually true" is an overriding diagnostic of mental illness.  <a href="/wiki/User:Wardog" title="User:Wardog">Iapetus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wardog" title="User talk:Wardog">talk</a>) 10:26, 13 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Not quite answering the OP's question about purposefully summoning, but related - there is such a thing as <a href="/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" title="Sleep paralysis">Sleep paralysis</a>, which is interpreted in many cultures around the world as a <a href="/wiki/Succubus" title="Succubus">Succubus</a>, as in many cases, it feels like someone or something is lying on top of you, and in other cases it feels like there is someone or something in the room (and, indeed, sometimes multiple entities). I started to get it when I was 16 (during exam time), then it stopped for a few years until I moved to Japan, and then I was getting it regularly. I knew it was just my body not 'waking up yet' even though my brain had, and therefore had no reason to think there were 'entities' in the room. It's a very unpleasant feeling, but I didn't seek medical help for it, because I knew what it was and it didn't interfere with my life. We talked about this a few weeks ago on here, and as one person noted (something which I already knew), it is claimed that it is very common in Japan. Bizarrely, that is where I got it most - probably just a coincidence, but there you go. <span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml"><font face="MV Boli" color="blue"><a href="/wiki/User:KageTora" title="User:KageTora">KägeTorä - (<sup>影</sup><sub>虎</sub>)</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KageTora" title="User talk:KageTora">もしもし！</a>)</font></span> 13:20, 11 April 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
