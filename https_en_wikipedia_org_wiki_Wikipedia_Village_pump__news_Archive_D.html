<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Anon._page_creation_disabled">Anon. page creation disabled</span></h2>
<p>As an experiment, page creation by anonymous users has been disabled on the English Wikipedia.  This was announced by <a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> on the WikiEN mailing list <a class="external autonumber" href="https://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-December/033880.html">[1]</a>.  The Seigenthaler case is stated as one of the motivating factors.  Anonymous users can still create Talk pages.  The text that anonymous users see when attempting to edit is at <a href="/wiki/MediaWiki:Nocreatetext" title="MediaWiki:Nocreatetext">Mediawiki:Nocreatetext</a>, if users have comments on the wording. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Creidieki" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 19:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thanks for providing the link. I guess I'm wondering if people are remembering that creating "new" pages is necessary to properly nominate articles for AfD, FAC, etc. Lack of people doing newpages patrol, and the increased 'noise' from ever-increasing tolerance of users adding large quantities of micro-stubs seem like problems that solving would provide more benefit than restricting anons. IE 'nothing but an infobox or navbox' should be speediable, as should bios that don't say who, what, and when, etc. And another note from Jimbo said to the effect of 'we should accomodate the occasional school article, but it would be a problem if people start mass adding them'. Well, mass adding has started--dozens of small school articles that say nothing but that it's a school, and maybe the district and/or city name, have been created recently. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.17.48.241&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.17.48.241 (page does not exist)">24.17.48.241</a> 20:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Good idea; a staggering number of new pages are garbage. I am wondering if it would be a good idea to add some text about how easy it is to create a new account to <a href="/wiki/MediaWiki:Nocreatetext" title="MediaWiki:Nocreatetext">Mediawiki:Nocreatetext</a>. I see stuff on the Web about registering, and I shudder (or turn to Bugmenot.) Adding such text could encourage honest anon editors to register (but it could encourage vandals, too...) <a href="/wiki/User:Massysett" title="User:Massysett">Massysett</a> 20:40, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This is outrageous. So many articles are started by anonymous users, and now we deny them the possibility to contribute. There was absolutely no reason to do that, and so many reasons why this shouldn't have been done. We say that "everyone can edit" yet we disable the basic functionality of asking question on Talk.

<dl><dd>It's an experiment. Give it a few days. I don't think it is useful either, but hey, they can switch it off again. After all, you're only discouraging sincere users. Kids who <i>want</i> to add their primary school, and vandals who <i>want</i> to create bogus articles will just create a throwaway account, and add an extra line of garbage to the database in doing so. Jimbo's post shows awareness of all this. If he decides the effect is not beneficient, it'll just be switched back to the way it was. <a href="/wiki/User:Dbachmann" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>&#5839;</b>)</a></small> 20:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The <i>free</i> part does not refer to the ability of anybody to create pages. For example, <a href="/wiki/Nupedia" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> was also a free encyclopedia, while being very far from allowing anonymous editors to contribute. Given the amount of nonsense created by anonymous users at newpages, I personally as a new-pages-patroller hope the change is permanent. <a href="/wiki/User:Thue" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thue" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 21:07, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Do we have stats for what proiportion of new pages created by anons are vandalism of one form or another?

<dl><dd>Just my opinion here, but when I first used Wikipedia in 2002, I was quite shocked to find that I could just go ahead and edit an article with nobody knowing who I was, not registering or anything.  I think that being allowed to do that without registering almost encourages new users to do something silly, like try out wiping a whole page or adding nonsense to the page or just writing a page about their pet dog, just because they can.  Greater accountability would increase the integrity of Wikipedia, which currently has a rather poor reputation in the wider community.  Whilst I know that a lot of high school students swear by it for research assignments, and a few tech gurus do as well, other than people who edit it and enjoy the community side to it, there are a lot of people who think that it is not really all that good.  I think that the general perception is that it is good in the sense of being a "community", as in like <a href="/wiki/LiveJournal" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> kind of thing, but as an actual resource, it is not generally perceived all that well.  Adding more accountability would improve this perception, and also make it a lot easier on everyone involved.  I actually don't see the harm in making a user create an account before even editing at all.  It's still free - you just need an account.  And I further don't see why we couldn't require people to register by e-mail like LiveJournal does.  Most places have that kind of thing, so why not here?  I think that long-term, while these bad press issues come in, we are going to have to head towards that kind of thing anyway. <a href="/wiki/User:Zordrac" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a>  <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zordrac" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a>  <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 21:47, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I agree with what you say, except that I think the "bad press" is irrelevant. They think Wikipedia is inferior -- well, to <i>what</i>? There is no comparable project. Nothing like it was tried before (or rather, no similar project was remotely as successful). Academic standards should be our aim, and we are very far removed from that, on average, but if you want to compare it to sources published by a board of editors, consider it a collection of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:FA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:FA">821 articles</a>. All the rest is just thrown in for what it is, take it or leave it. I am afraid that academic standards are no nearer even with anons blocked completely; WP's "anti-acedemic bias" is, sadly, an entirely different discussion. <a href="/wiki/User:Dbachmann" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>&#5839;</b>)</a></small> 21:54, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><b>THERE was very good reason to do this</b>  If you disagree then I doubt you've have new page patrolled.  I did for a month.  From what I observed, the vast majority of anon contributions had to be speedied, afd'd, or copyvio'd; and, the ones that remained were poor stubs on microparts of larger subjects.  However, maybe we should allow anons to create articles through existing red links?  <a href="/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lotsofissues">Lotsofissues</a> 22:29, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I agree; the percentage of valuable new pages that come from anons is pretty small.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I'm still shocked that Jimbo actually did it, given the arguments I've read about anonymous users being valuable, but I'll be interested to see how the experiment pans out.  I think that most "drive-by" anonymous edits which are valuable are going to be to existing pages, not new ones, and registration is not that big a hurdle to someone interested enough to create a new page.  I think perhaps something about "you can <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F" title="Wikipedia:Why create an account?">register for an account</a>" should be added to Nocreatetext, though.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I was just thinking the other day that it might be good to disallow anon-page-creation (or even disallow anon-editing at all) for limited amounts of time -- one day a week, or one day a month, or something -- just to allow RC and NewPage patrollers a "Day of Rest".  They could help with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Backlog" title="Wikipedia:Backlog">Wikipedia:Backlog</a>, or (gasp) actually work on their own interests, without fretting over the rising tide of dreck.  I didn't think it was a likely proposal in the traditional Wikipedia climate, and I do fear the <a href="/wiki/Slippery_slope" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> effect of "but it's so much NICER around here on Rest Days"....but what do other folks think of the notion?   &#8212; <a href="/wiki/User:CatherineMunro" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:CatherineMunro" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl><dd>As a developer, maybe you know, if there is any way to allow anons to create articles only from red links?

<dl><dd>I see vandals from wikipedia-watch quickly adapting.  But the dumb kid who just wants to say his school is gay?  Red links show there is either not enough interest or knowledge in the existing membership to start an article.  We need to open those links to newcomers.  <a href="/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lotsofissues">Lotsofissues</a> 08:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think that <a href="/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lotsofissues">Lotsofissues</a> is making a very good suggestion. Anons should be able to create any page that is linked to from an article.  A system like this would still prevent anons from creating nonsense pages, while allowing them to create wanted articles and to perform such tasks as adding articles to AfD.  Some vandals will realize how to get around it, but anyone who can figure out to get around it by adding a link to an existing article is smart enough to get around the current system by creating an account.  Does anyone know if this idea is technically feasible? <a href="/wiki/User:Canderson7" title="User:Canderson7">Canderson7</a> <sup>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Canderson7" title="User talk:Canderson7">talk</a>)</sup> 16:29, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>this move is a start, but only a start. that it took a major media fiasco to get action on this problem is rather sad - i think wikipedia needs to start being proactive, rather than reactive. i'm a newer wikipedian. i like wikipedia, and i dislike it. i've written some screedishness on my user page. the suggestion that anons are valuable is, in my opinion, rubbish. oh, i'm certain there are anons that have contributed valuable info. i'm also quite certain they could have contributed that info non-anonymously, just as well. this new move does not go far enough. to edit, one should have to sign up, and respond to an email 'opt in'. the user can still remain - fundamentally, and patently in effect - anonymous. but they must at least show that they're willing to 'stand behind' what they write, at least to the extent that someone can contact them and say 'stop being a putz'. and yes, nothing to stop the truly committed 'anon' from just using a throwaway address for the signup. but at minimum, it adds a crucial layer of committment a step away from simply clicking, and writing 'i have a giant penis' in the middle of an article. in the couple of months i've been here, the flow of "rv" "rv" "rv" "rv" "rv" that goes past in my watchlist is, really, laughable. so many good faith people have their time burned by the bad faith people out there. why be a doormat for people who have crap on their minds? (yes, i'm in a screedalicious mood)....at any rate, if you are interested, feel free to visit my user page for more ramblings. <a href="/wiki/User:Anastrophe-wikipedia" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 00:03, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
</p><p>I like what Jimbo is at least trying this out. Maybe we could also have a brief period of disallowing any anon edits and then comparing whether vandalism decreased and other useful statistics. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Gflores&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gflores (page does not exist)">Gflores</a> <sup><a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gflores&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gflores (page does not exist)">Talk</a></sup> 01:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
</p><p>I don't think anon new pages are as much more likely to be problematic as people seem to assume. For example, of the 11 pages listed as copyvio so far today, 7 are from registered users (most added before the anon new page lock went into effect). If people aren't checking reg edits during NP/RC patrol, I think a lot is getting missed. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.17.48.241&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.17.48.241 (page does not exist)">24.17.48.241</a> 02:44, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>A more recent example: <a href="/wiki/User:Emperor" title="User:Emperor">User:Emperor</a>, who has been registered for almost 3 years, just did a cut&amp;paste move of the content of <a href="/wiki/Futurequake" class="mw-redirect" title="Futurequake">Futurequake</a> to <a href="/wiki/FutureQuake" title="FutureQuake">FutureQuake</a> (if an admin reading this could merge the histories--they both have multiple edits now). <i>All edits need to be checked</i>, and the only way I see that happening is if more people start doing NP and RC patrol; the population of 'checkers' does not seem to have increased nearly proportional to the increase in the number of 'editors/adders'. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.17.48.241&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.17.48.241 (page does not exist)">24.17.48.241</a> 04:23, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The only issue I have with this as a frequent RC and NP patroller is that now it is a bit harder to tell the "good" from the "bad" on each of these lists. I think a sizeable chunk of our former anonymous vandals are now getting one-hit-wonder logins, doing their thing, and then probably disappearing into the night. Don't get me wrong; if this makes blocking or cleanup easier in some way I don't see, then I'm all for it. <a href="/wiki/User:ESkog" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> | <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:ESkog" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a></sup> 03:09, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

</p><p>Having spent much of my time on Wikipedia adding delete tags to pointless new articles (and actually enjoying it, strangely) I see why this change might be necessary.  90% of the articles I've added said tags to have been created by anons, though I do of course click on the anon ones more as they're more suspicious.  There are of course many good articles created by anons but hopefully the registration process shows itself to be  quick and easy for them (which it is, I was pretty surprised how it only took a few seconds when I did it).  It might make sense to highlight exactly what you need to register. Generally though, apart from being slightly scared this will lead to registration for all users after a similar case, which  I think is certainly a bad idea I just about agree with it. <a href="/wiki/User:Jellypuzzle" title="User:Jellypuzzle">Jellypuzzle</a> 10:51, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd>And now 95% of the articles you tag will be by redlinked usernames.

<p>So it looks like crybaby Siegenthaler accomplished what many community activists could not achieve--controlling what anons could do in the Wikipedia.  However, even though I feel favorable to restricting the creation of articles (and even "major degree" changes) by anons, it appears that Mr. Wales has trumped any community discussion of this.  That is rather alarming.  That he has allowed an old crybaby to force through a change in the nature of Wikipedia portends bad things ahead if this decision isn't entered into a proper community decision process as soon as possible. &#8212; <a href="/wiki/User:Stevietheman" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stevietheman" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Stevietheman" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 16:28, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Wales' dictatorial approach <i>has</i> to stop somehow.  It isn't helpful, and it prevents discussion of "trivial" changes that really aren't trivial at all.

<p>Not only was I anonymous editor for a fair while before becoming pseudonymous, but I have also done new page patrol.  I disagree with <a href="/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Lotsofissues">Lotsofissues</a>.  I, for one, remember being anonymous myself.  The very first new page that I created as an anonymous editor was nominated for deletion minutes after I created it.  I argued the case to keep it, and the page was kept.  Had this gross assumption of bad faith, simply on the grounds that someone chooses not to create an account, been in place when I first came here, I wouldn't be here now.  Anonymity does <i>not</i> imply bad faith.  Anonymous users make thousands of good faith edits to Wikipedia every day.  Indeed, since the subject of preventing anonymous users from nominating articles for deletion has come up, I point out that there was an anonymous user who made an AFD nomination very recently that put the nominations of many <i>pseudonymous</i> users to shame.  <a href="/wiki/User:Uncle_G" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

Conclusion: if we force people to register to create new pages, and registering is that easy, a big effect is reducing our trust in registered users as a group; it requires more emphasis on checking each person's contribution history, and less of "oh, well he bothered to register, that's worth something". <a href="/wiki/User:Rd232" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rd232" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 15:05, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

Legitimate users (who will only have to do this once, ever) won't mind, especially if we explain to them upfront the reason why; on the other hand, mass-creators of abusive sockpuppets will have a small extra hassle to go through each time they burn a sockpuppet through vandalism.

<p>I agree.  Anonymity does not imply bad faith.  I don't think Wikipedia should cave to outside pressure to change its policies - any policy changes should arise from discussions within the community, not imposed from the top down.  I think it's crucial to keep independence and allow anonymity.  I was an anonymous user and made several edits and started articles before eventually registering.  One of Wikipedia's strengths (and weaknesses) is that it is easy to edit and easy to get started.  Requiring vandals to register will do nothing to stop determined vandals, and will only discourage new users.  The restriction on creating new articles sounds like more of a public relations move than an actual solution -- it does nothing to address the criticisms of Wikipedia that were raised.   And as a public relations move it sends the wrong message -- that the people running Wikipedia can be intimidated into making changes in the procedures and infrastructure of Wikipedia by a little bit of bad press.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Flow&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Flow (page does not exist)">Flow</a> 01:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I predict the following observation: Wikipedia still works well without anons creating articles, and we will have less work.<br />It doesn't follow that this is a good idea, or that this is a bad idea. In fact, I sincerely doubt we'll reach any conclusion at all, since nobody has established <i>what we are trying to accomplish</i>. This could very well stick around through sheer inertia. Who is going to come up with concrete evidence of what the difference to Wikipedia is? How do you measure improvement? In number of lawsuit scares per second?<br />Incidentally, I see both glowing praise in the media for this as a reaction to the Seigenthaler incident, and damning criticism of the "closing the barn door after the horse has left" kind.

<p>It seems to me that editing "anonymously" actually exposed <i>more</i> information about you to the general public, by exposing your IP address.  For people editing from an Internet cafe, or from a large ISP that dynamically assigns addresses in a large range or puts people behind proxies, that doesn't matter so much.  But for many people, as for our hoaxster, that number will identify either your home or your employer.  If you register, access to this information becomes restricted to a much smaller set of people.  If you edit from multiple locations, you could associate those edits as being from the same person by registering, but on the other hand, you could always register for multiple accounts, and no one would be the wiser.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Side_effects_of_requiring_registration">Side effects of requiring registration</span></h3>
<p>I think some people are under the misimpression that just because anyone who wants to create a new article <i>could</i> register to do so, they <i>will</i> do so.  Registration is a hoop to jump through, and a small annoyance.  Just because someone intends to do something, does not mean they will continue to want to do so once it becomes clear that the process is more annoying or requires more effort than they thought when they started out.  So while <i>some</i> people will register to get around the restriction, <i>everyone</i> in that situation will <i>not</i>, and that's pretty much the point.  Having to also create a userpage, for instance, would be yet another hoop, which would result in another drop in participation.  So while there may be a slippery slope here, it is an uphill one. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Beland" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 19:14, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl><dd><ul><li>IMHO, I think all anon activity should be curtailed, not just new article creation. This is not a free-speech issue. It's a responsibility issue. Requiring contributors to create an account with a linked email addy would significantly reduce vandalism. One can still contribute anonymously by signing up via a Hotmail account. My name isn't really Juan Oso. I contribute anonymously. However, if there were to be a problem, I am more easily traced. Free speech does not mean anyone can say anything anywhere at any time. One has no right to scream "fire" in a crowded theater. One has no right to spray-paint "Bush sucks" on the front of my house.

<p>I'd like to make a few points here.
</p>
<ul><li>Mr Gardner is a convicted and registered sex offender. He was convicted of "coerced or forced sex." True enough, since whatever happened was with his 14 year old girlfriend when he was only 18 this seems rather extreme, but he didn't go to prison for it and we don't know all the circumstances. The only reason he's in jail now is that he was dumb enough to violate his probation, mostly by pulling that "Duke of Cleveland" stunt at the high school in Minnesota. His probation officer called him on his mobile phone and he turned himself in to the  local police.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Whether or not his fraudulent content was quickly reverted on Wikipedia, it spewed out to Nationmaster where it stayed for months. That's where the student reporters found the Wikipedia content. Since he'd included his real name, that's also how they were able to track him further and uncover his "sex offender" status.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Hence, like it or not and sadly so, Wikipedia enabled the fraud of a registered sex offender by not controlling its content. How many articles in Wikipedia (the ones nobody cares about and aren't watched) are perpetuating frauds like this one?</li></ul>
<ul><li>I see no reason why the Duke of Cleveland article should contain any reference to Mr Gardner after a few more months have passed. However, it might be helpful to leave it there for now as a service to someone who has run across any remaining shreds of his fraud and looks up the topic for more information. <a href="/wiki/User:The_Witch" title="User:The Witch">The Witch</a> 19:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Long live Wikipedia, and I wish you a happy millionth article. We are looking forward to our 25.000th, which is an enormous development given the very limited number of Hungarian editors. In any case, let's celebrate and let's groove tonight (wow), I am very happy and pleased to be part of the community in Hungary, maybe later worldwide, of Wiki, I found young clean and productive people being able to set aside their exams and other responsibilities in order to produce something BIG on Wiki. I have sometimes second thoughts about their developemnts, but at 40 I understand there are many important things in life.

I am seeking your guidance and advice on a particular issue. <a href="/wiki/Mahuri" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> page on wikipedia was initiated by me, and I have contributed to the page from time to time. As per policy of the wikipedia anyone can use the contents of wikipedia, but I understand that use of such contents should indicate the source, that is, the wikipedia. The contents of the page Mahuri have been used in the site <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mahurivaisya.com/#">mahurivaisya</a> without giving any reference to wikipedia - though I am glad that they have used our contents. In this case, a problem may arise at a future date if that website  takes a stand that the contents of page <a href="/wiki/Mahuri" title="Mahuri">Mahuri</a> on wikipedia have been copied from that site and thus violates copyrights. In an alternative scenario, a user here may tag our Mahuri page with copyright violation under the impression that our contents have been copied from that site, reference to which was given by me long back as an external link when that site was not active and having only a welcome page. Although I am not aware of any such issue, which wikipedians may have encountered in the past, I believe that such a situation may have arisen earlier too.

<dl><dd>Hmm. I read the article. I think it is safe to say that people will conclude: "Don't trust Wikipedia for information about politicians". The trouble is that some organisations really do have money and time to throw at 'slanting' pages, putting a 'spin' on things.

<p>I'd like to point out that it is my belief there are many people wanting to use Wikipedia as a kind of "Public Service Message Board". Well, that's not useful here and can potentially be downright damaging (libelous, etc.). Categories are meant to help people <b>find material</b>, not to <i><b>label</b></i> material. This is an attempt to raise consciousness of something I haven't seen brought up much (though comments/debate may exist in some corner of Wikipedia I haven't seen).

<p>"John Seigenthaler, Sr., long-time journalist and editor for The Tennessean, spoke to faculty from the Middle Tennessee State University College of Mass Communication on Wednesday, addressing ethics and accountability in online journalism and information sharing.

<p>The Meehan story is just the tip of the iceberg. Now that every political operative in the country knows about Wikipedia, it's open season on political articles. I've already started noticing suspicious edits to Tennessee candidate articles since the Meehan story. The most blatant example being someone <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phil_Bredesen&amp;diff=38619021&amp;oldid=38333006">completely rewriting</a> the article on <a href="/wiki/Phil_Bredesen" title="Phil Bredesen">Phil Bredesen</a> to make it sound like a promotional brochure. And of course the editor was an anonymous IP address with <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=207.65.22.105">no previous edits</a>. What can we do about this? If it's already this bad now, what can we expect once election season approaches?! Something needs to be done to address this before it gets out of control. <a href="/wiki/User:Kaldari" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 18:12, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>A vandal is still a vandal, whether they're inserting images of feces or promoting their favourite political candidate. All we can do is fight them as we always have, with rollbacks, blocks, and the occasional protection. I seriously doubt any political candidate is literally going to pay people to corrupt Wikipedia - their followers are just a little overzealous. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Deco&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Deco (page does not exist)">Deco</a> 20:28, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>In the interest of preparing for election seasons, it might help to have a little template identifying biographies of political candidates with current campaigns.

<dd>The problem is that this type of vandalism is much more difficult to identify and deal with. Unless someone wants to volunteer to watch all of the politician articles in Tennessee, I'm tempted to semi-protect all of them once election season rolls around. Of course this is in complete violation of the semi-protection policy, but I'm not sure which is worse, having semi-protected articles or having articles written by politicians. For national politicians, it isn't such a big deal because they are heavily watched, but for local politicians in many cases there are only 1 or 0 people watching them. Should I just throw up my hands and give them over to the political operatives? No one else seems to be watching any of the ones in Tennessee and I don't intend to try to police all of them myself. Maybe we can set up some kind of group watchlist that political articles can be nominated to. <a href="/wiki/User:Kaldari" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 23:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It might be useful to collect a list or category of such pages so that they can be watched separately for recent changes. We can certainly deal with this sort of POV pushing, especially if editors are aggressive about removing additions that are not sourced.

<p><b><u>I caught you guys red-handed with "Article laundering".</u></b>  I don't trust you as much as I can throw you. I want to let the wide Wikipedian community at large be appraised of what is going on. One wikipedian deletes an external link as " (rv to SimonP; Wikiinfo not sister project)."  My external links don't violate your policy!!!! But I think there is a much more sinister motive out there!!<br />
The case of article laundering at<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imprint_on_politics/Revision">Cultural imprint on politics/Revision at Wikipedia</a>.  Which was conventently deleted recently.  Here is a quote from someone on that page:
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>This is a draft for a fair rewrite of an encyclopedic subject that simply discusses the imprint that culture has on politics.

Don't make angry edits, try to forget any agenda of your own, and keep the English-speaking reader firmly in mind. Thanks.</b></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>You were attempting to steal an article at Wikinfo!!!!  You deleted it. And then try to surreptissiously put it on your site ""Washed"" without tracing back!!!!!  This is morally wrong for you people.  I see your extermination policy of external links!!!! ala Bill Gates---you guys take lessons from him!!!! Instead of bringing it back on and referencing it back to Wikinfo---You are attempting to "Article laundering" in defiance of copyright laws regarding Wiki's.  You people are evil.  Do you have that much hatred for Wikinfo???  Is Hate the basis of what goes on around here???
</p><p>Now, I am rightfully scared that anytime I try to put an external link---they will delete it--run out---create another article on the subject--put in on Wikipedia themselves--thus preventing any external link!!!!  I see this game you guys are trying to pull.  And this should be noted.!!!! 
</p><p>Where is the trust and professional ethics here at Wikipedia???  I don't mind making external links, I know you don't like me or my work, but if you are going to be stealing stuff without proper trails, I am forced to post here at Wikipedia. I want it noted that it is wrong to steal and Article Laundering.

<dl><dd>I can't tell exactly what you're on about, but copying text that you have released under the GFDL to another GFDL site isn't "stealing" in any sense of the word. You explicitly gave anyone in the world permission to do so. And the impression I get is that it's largely rewritten anyway to be NPOV.

<dl><dd>Rspeer, there is NO objection to the material being used here at Wikipedia.  If that is the case---THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE MOVED IT BACK TO WIKIPEDIA, DID THEIR EDITING IN PUBLIC WITH A REFERENCE BACK TO WHERE THEY GOT THE INFORMATION AND IDEA.

There is NO problem in taking material from Wikinfo, but you MUST reference back!!!!  That was not done!!!  People were attempting to "launder" an article and not give proper trails to where that information came from.  The problem is that Wikipedians smug in their arrogance wanted to take material without referencing back according to Wiki rules and the GNU license.  You must always reference where you got the material!!!!  Take all you want---BUT YOU HAVE TO REFERENCE IT.  This is what Wikipedians do NOT want to do!!!!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_millionth_article">The millionth article</span></h2>
<p>Earlier today I made changes to <i>SiteStatsUpdate.php</i> that logs the name of the article + the count every time something that qualifies as an article in MediaWiki is saved on the English Wikipedia, i.e. a page in the main namespace which is not a redirect and contains the string "[[" (without quotes) to log which article was the millionth, mainly because it's easy and is curious for historical reasons.
</p><p>Of course when I was going to apply it and roll it out I found out that <a href="/wiki/User:Tim_Starling" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> had already done the same thing in almost the same way, just a bit better. So yay to him, the output you see below is generated by his stuff;)
</p><p>As I write this we're about 200 short of a million, this of course raises the question of what the millionth article will be about and how descriptive it'll be of the project as a whole. One might worry that the millionth article would be something childish that'll get deleted within minutes, a minor list or some insignificant subject that we'll never get to featured status and one might view as undescriptive of the project as a whole.
</p><p>But the thing is, that whatever it'll be about, or whatever its ultimate fate (deletion?), it will be descriptive of the project.
</p><p>We have our ups and downs, we have our vandalism, we have our spambots and we have our excellent articles, but as we cross a million articles the thing that matters the most is not which article just happens to be the millionth, but the fact that we're getting ever closer to (and already achieving) our goal of being an excellent <a href="/wiki/Free_content" title="Free content">free</a> information source and that our editing process, although it has its ups and downs, invites people to participate (albeit with uneven results) and thus eliminates the gap between the ones that have the knowledge and those that distribute it.

<dd>I agree calm down. I don't speak German but why it should be of such mortal concern to anyone that the German version could be better then English I don't know. Also, pointing out one mistake is rather silly. I don't know who Christoph Kardinal Schönborn is but one single error doesn't go any way to prove or deny the accuracy of the German wikipedia over the English version.

<dl><dd>Personally, I agree that it's a dud idea - for now. In the distant future, 10 years maybe, when the major articles have been peer reviewed enough and sourced enough, it could be a possible thing for large libraries and such.

<dl><dd>I'm not sure that this is ever likely to be an especially useful idea. Searching through a collection of 1,000,000 short articles will always be easier in hypertext than in a physical book, and surely the cost of books is only going up while the cost of connecting to the internet, or buying a DVD-ROM and something that can read it, is only going down. <a href="/wiki/User:Christopher_Parham" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Christopher_Parham" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 06:44, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Regardless of the relative merits of the German and English versions, I find it hard to see the advantages of issuing a print version over a DVD version.

<dl><dd>Except that DVD versions don't work if you don't have a computer as with probably 85% of the world? Of course, a great number of those who are least likely to be able to use a DVD version probably don't understand German but the fact of the matter is a print version would be useful to people who don't have a computer and don't have easy access to one. Don't get me wrong, I do think the print idea was a mistake, but print has numerous advantages over DVD (just as DVD has numerous advantages over print) <a href="/wiki/User:Nil_Einne" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:20, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>It <i>is</i> a project to improve the paranormal related articles. Some paranormal reports are based on witness testimony, which can lead to "hard evidence", such as when someone says that a ghost is carrying objects around in a haunted construct, such as a house, ship, plane, then one sets up surveillance gear up in said construct, and it catches the ghost in the act. Have you been in a "haunted house"&#160;? If so, you can get a tape recorder with NEW tapes, then go to a haunted place/construct, then set it up, and you'll be amazed at what you got. One person asked if anyone is home, in a <i>empty</i> house, and a presence told him to "GET OUT!". That was caught on tape. The reason you use NEW tapes is to reduce, if not eliminate the "noise" found on a used, but erased tape. I have worked with police regularly, thus I know how to handle evidence. <a href="/wiki/User:Martial_Law" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 22:22, 15 April 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>This letter <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iranian.com/Letters/2006/April/b.html#5">[7]</a> posted to the Iranian forum iranian.com accuses WP of fomenting ethnic discord in Iran:
</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in 2005 when I put together the compilation "What if", I knew these days were coming.
</p><p>Since then, I have been working full time on Wikipedia to upload and publish as much documentation and information as possible from Iran's history, heritage, people, culture, and identity, before it is all "liberated" and bombed back into the stone age.
</p><p>Make no mistake: This war will not just incur huge loss of life. It will cost Iran its sovereignty and its very identity. At best, it will turn Iran into a rubbled obsolete Afghanistan. At worst, it will tear up Iran into ethnic pieces, carving out several new republics. The ethnic posse are already hard at work on Wikipedia, actively defaming Iran and her people in every possible way, and selling the idea of Balkanization of Iran to Wikipedia's 2 Billion visitors per month.

</p><p>Britannica make some good points in their critique, but they are equally disingenuous. In pointing out that some of comparisons were made against articles in the ancilliary publications or conjoined sections of articles, they are presumably failing to mention that they are simply missing articles on significant subjects. Does a subscriber to the online Britannica looking up <a href="/wiki/Dolly_the_Sheep" class="mw-redirect" title="Dolly the Sheep">Dolly the Sheep</a> or <a href="/wiki/Steven_Wolfram" class="mw-redirect" title="Steven Wolfram">Steven Wolfram</a> genuinely realise they are accessing a lower quality, ancilliary article? I would assume that owners of the print edition get nothing. If Nature had compared them on the print edition they would have probably scored 'strike zero' on significant omissions for not having the article. Similarly on the cobbled together articles, if a reader of Britannica looked up <a href="/wiki/Aldol_reaction" title="Aldol reaction">aldol reaction</a> would they have found anything? You could argue that Nature were quite soft on Britannica by allowing redirects to relevant subsections. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Solipsist" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 21:29, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

a group of Wikipedians led by the Wikimedia Foundation
has established a new secret wiki on remote webservers.
The evil Britannica, obsessed with the young Foundation,
has dispatched thousands of lawyers and spin doctors
into the far reaches of the Web...

<p>In this week's Economist there was an entire long article about Wikipedia!
</p><p>They made Britannica look silly!
</p><p>Excerpts:
</p><p>"Privately, however, Britannica's editors were shocked to have to concede that their creation contained any errors at all. Total accuracy, after all, is the main selling point for the old media. So Dale Hoiberg, Britannica's current editor-in-chief, commissioned his own review of the study and found that “Nature did everything wrong that they could possibly have done wrong.” Last month Nature issued a rebuttal. But if it did get it wrong, it is not clear why it would have erred more for Britannica than for Wikipedia. Mr Hoiberg puts a brave face on it, claiming that “our model, although not perfect, is the best.”
</p><p>For a lot of new-media watchers, the most interesting thing about the episode was something entirely different: that Britannica, somewhat representative of old media in general, instinctively regards Wikipedia as a threat, whereas Wikipedians are not the least bit tempted to reciprocate. “I'm a big fan of Britannica's work,” says Mr Wales, adding that he is not motivated by “disrupting” anybody, and is glad that Brockhaus, the biggest encyclopedia in Germany (where Wikipedia is very popular), appears to be doing better than ever. But why not have a free alternative as well? And why not test the limits of what social collaboration can do? Mr Wales is the first to admit that “there are some inherent limitations,” and says they are busy trying to discover what they are.
</p><p>Contrast that with the joyful reaction of Wikipedia's detractors to Brian Chase, the dodgy biographer (whose article was literally one in a million). Somebody who reads Wikipedia is “rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom,” says Mr McHenry, Britannica's former editor. “It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him.” One wonders whether people like Mr McHenry would prefer there to be no public lavatories at all."

<dl><dd>More sloppiness from a "reputable" source - McHenry's comments were made well before the Siegenthaler incident, not in response to it. Another reminder of the low standards that prevail among professional experts, but otherwise a welcome article.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:62.31.55.223&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:62.31.55.223 (page does not exist)">62.31.55.223</a> 18:05, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>McHenry has found a way to make criticizing Wikipedia a nice little business; I've seen him quoted on one or two websites that I thought were beneath a self-respecting intellectual.

<dl><dd>I don't know about anything on the POV issue, but if your going to have a semi-POV fork (<a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_Wal-Mart" class="mw-redirect" title="Criticism of Wal-Mart">Criticism of Wal-Mart</a>), the very least you could do is leave it in the walmart article. Somehow they shifted a lot of material to that page, and then deleated the link.

<dd>On a slight tangent; I'd like to take all the Pro-x and Anti-x articles and combine them into a properly balanced article about x.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_Britannica_editor_criticizes_Wikipedia">Former Britannica editor criticizes Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Robert_McHenry" title="Robert McHenry">Robert McHenry</a>, a former <a href="/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> editor says in this <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-edemocracy/wikipedia_bias_3621.jsp">[12]</a> <a href="/wiki/OpenDemocracy" title="OpenDemocracy">openDemocracy</a> article "Wikipedia's visionless, self-selected, value-light online encyclopedia is a deformed shadow of what the global public deserves". He specially criticizes the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Countering systemic bias</a> WikiProject. --<a href="/wiki/User:Julianortega" title="User:Julianortega">Julián Ortega</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Julianortega" title="User talk:Julianortega">drop me a message</a> 20:33, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Perhaps, but in some ways Brittanica is a uniform shadow of our deformed shadow.&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/User:Superm401" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Superm401" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 05:24, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>But you could say its <i>visionless, self-selected</i> nature is its greatest strength. This means that to a large extent wikipedia reflects the interests of the internet at large, and also by the same measure that we meet the need of our us readers better. So the average internet user is perhaphs more interested in the latest eviction from <a href="/wiki/Big_brother" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Big brother">big brother</a>, or some obscure band, than it is in the exploits of some <a href="/wiki/Dead_White_European_Male" class="mw-redirect" title="Dead White European Male">Dead White European Male</a>. Well wikipedia will serve their needs better than britanica's narrow view of what we should be interested in. The day we give up on trying the ape britanica the better.
<dl><dd>"It is unremarkable that the topics covered at present in Wikipedia reflect the interests of those who contribute to it, and that these contributors represent a relatively narrow, self-selected segment of society." As opposed to that rainbow of diversity, the typical encyclopedia's editorial board. Seriously, this article is dumb. <a href="/wiki/User:Xanthoxyl" title="User:Xanthoxyl">Xanthoxyl</a> 23:17, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>ps. Also worth reading is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article.jsp?id=8&amp;debateId=85&amp;articleId=3584">The sultan and the glamour model</a> the pro WP article which McHenry was responding to. --<a href="/wiki/User:Salix_alba" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Salix_alba" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 07:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Of his two conclusions one, that WP has not realised "the basis for any intellectual work is that truth [...] is not democratically determined." is contradicted by <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (but supported by the way some people use AfD). <i><a href="/wiki/User:Rich_Farmbrough" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rich_Farmbrough" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 09:55 <a href="/wiki/10_June" class="mw-redirect" title="10 June">10  June</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).
</p>
<dl><dd>I found it a pretty decent analysis. I agree with McHenry that we could use a bit more vision and that we are too much of a democracy. His statement "that some excellent work – and there is some – is rendered suspect [both by the ideologically required openness of the process and] by association with much distinctly not excellent work that is accorded equal standing by that same ideology" reflects my feelings, except for the phrase that I put between brackets. I'm less concerned with the inbalance present in Wikipedia (by the way, as I read it, McHenry is supportive of the Countering Systemic Bias WikiProject, he just thinks it should be called Countering Systemic Inbalance). -- <a href="/wiki/User:Jitse_Niesen" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jitse_Niesen" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:46, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>He's just a bitter old man. His own aspirations for Britannica failed, he lost his job, and now he is feeling malicious. There is no "ideologically required openness", it's just the way we do things because it's the way that works best. This analysis is too skewed to take seriously as he has no interest in appraisingly Wikipedia fairly or offering constructive suggestions; he has no respect for Wikipedia's achievements and just wants it to die. He is bitter and totally lacking in grace, decency or class. <a href="/wiki/User:Honbicot" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> 23:49, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It does not reflect well on us as editors of Wikipedia to be disparaging editors of other encyclopedias (former or otherwise) as "bitter old men".  You should be ashamed of yourself, Honbicot.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well the key question remains how to deal with bias.  Any knowledge management activity will have bias, and Wikipedia is biased towards the interests of the group that edit it, the social class of "nerds", "dorks" and "comic book guys" (of which I am a member).  People will know what they are interested in and like.  Anyways the idea that self appointed ediors will accomplish an entire independence from all bias or emotional clouding is silly.  So perhaps just making more clearly questions raised about articles would be better than trying to make things perfect to an impossible standard.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>But you could say its <i>visionless, self-selected</i> nature is its greatest strength. This means that to a large extent wikipedia reflects the interests of the internet at large, and also by the same measure that we meet the need of our us readers better. So the average internet user is perhaphs more interested in the latest eviction from <a href="/wiki/Big_brother" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Big brother">big brother</a>, or some obscure band, than it is in the exploits of some <a href="/wiki/Dead_White_European_Male" class="mw-redirect" title="Dead White European Male">Dead White European Male</a>. Well wikipedia will serve their needs better than britanica's narrow view of what we should be interested in. The day we give up on trying the ape britanica the better.
<dl><dd>"It is unremarkable that the topics covered at present in Wikipedia reflect the interests of those who contribute to it, and that these contributors represent a relatively narrow, self-selected segment of society."

<p>Of his two conclusions one, that WP has not realised "the basis for any intellectual work is that truth <a href="/wiki/..." class="mw-redirect" title="...">...</a> is not democratically determined." is contradicted by <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (but supported by the way some people use AfD). <i><a href="/wiki/User:Rich_Farmbrough" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rich_Farmbrough" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 09:55 <a href="/wiki/10_June" class="mw-redirect" title="10 June">10 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).

<dl><dd>I found it a pretty decent analysis. I agree with McHenry that we could use a bit more vision and that we are too much of a democracy. His statement "that some excellent work – and there is some – is rendered suspect <a href="/w/index.php?title=Both_by_the_ideologically_required_openness_of_the_process_and&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Both by the ideologically required openness of the process and (page does not exist)">both by the ideologically required openness of the process and</a> by association with much distinctly not excellent work that is accorded equal standing by that same ideology" reflects my feelings, except for the phrase that I put between brackets. I'm less concerned with the inbalance present in Wikipedia (by the way, as I read it, McHenry is supportive of the Countering Systemic Bias WikiProject, he just thinks it should be called Countering Systemic Inbalance). -- <a href="/wiki/User:Jitse_Niesen" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jitse_Niesen" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:46, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>He's just a bitter old man. His own aspirations for Britannica failed, he lost his job, and now he is feeling malicious. There is no "ideologically required openness", it's just the way we do things because it's the way that works best. This analysis is too skewed to take seriously as he has no interest in appraisingly Wikipedia fairly or offering constructive suggestions; he has no respect for Wikipedia's achievements and just wants it to die. He is bitter and totally lacking in grace, decency or class. <a href="/wiki/User:Honbicot" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> 23:49, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It does not reflect well on us as editors of Wikipedia to be disparaging editors of other encyclopedias (former or otherwise) as "bitter old men". You should be ashamed of yourself, Honbicot.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Well the key question remains how to deal with bias. Any knowledge management activity will have bias, and Wikipedia is biased towards the interests of the group that edit it, the social class of "nerds", "dorks" and "comic book guys" (of which I am a member). People will know what they are interested in and like. Anyways the idea that self appointed ediors will accomplish an entire independence from all bias or emotional clouding is silly. So perhaps just making more clearly questions raised about articles would be better than trying to make things perfect to an impossible standard.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Guidelines_issued_for_PR_on_Wikipedia">Guidelines issued for PR on Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>Following fallout after PR activities on Wikipedia by some organizations, the <a href="/wiki/Public_Relations_Society_of_America" title="Public Relations Society of America">Public Relations Society of America</a> has issued guidelines for PR on Wikipedia.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.prsa.org/viewNews.cfm?pNewsID=197">[15]</a> One guideline is for organizations to start a transparent user account that identifies itself as being a representative of the organization.
</p>
<ul><li>Be transparent, not anonymous. Clearly identify yourself as a representative for your organization and establish a user name under which all your organization’s edits will be referenced (perhaps something like “company X representative”). It’s also possible to associate a “user information page” with your user name — you may want to create a brief page explaining that you are a paid representative for your organization and are posting on its behalf. Only use this user name for work-related Wikipedia entries; if you get bit by the Wikipedia bug and want to edit articles on your own time about, say, poodles in 19th-century France, create a different user name. Transparency up-front can help avoid a lot of trouble later on.</li></ul>

<p>Hi all... I'm the author of the article on the PRSA Web site (and, for the record, am not a WP admin, just a regular old Wikipedian, and, gasp, a PR person!). I worked hard to try and fully explain the Wikipedia concept and protocols to a novice audience, so I'm glad that came across. One note is that the article does not really represent "PRSA guidelines," but rather was just an article that I wrote and submitted to the professional journal on my own. I guess since they published the article it shows a tacit approval of the suggestions, but that's as far as it goes. <a href="/wiki/User:Jmabel" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> made two good observations that are worth reading (see his link above), and that I generally agree with.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Briwasson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Briwasson (page does not exist)">Briwasson</a> 00:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

</p>
<dl><dd>Since adding the little donation link for anons, Wikipedia is taking in $30k/month over paypal. And the last fundraiser took in ~$400k. Shortly thereafter $140k of new hardware was ordered, but I can find no records of additional purchases since then. So maybe the foundation has had enough on hand to cover expenses without asking for more donations. That said, there has been a good deal of fundraising chatter on <a href="/wiki/Foundation-l" class="mw-redirect" title="Foundation-l">foundation-l</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised to see another fundraiser soon. <a href="/wiki/User:Dragons_flight" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:01, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Donations since the last fundraiser have been at a higher rate than anticipated, so a further fundraiser has not been required yet. This has all been discussed recently on the (public) mailing list; it is not being left until the last minute. Having discussions on a mailing list is not in any way antiwiki.

<p>I agree, Sumahoy. I've been trying to figure these things out too, and it isn't as easy as it seems like it should be. I joined the foundation mailing list a few days ago, so maybe that will help. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that the Foundation gets private grants in addition to the public fundraisers; if that's true, it would help explain where all the money is coming from. If it's not true, and all the money comes from the public fundraisers, then maybe it still adds up, but it's hard for me to figure out how. For example, Dragons flight mentions above that the last fundraiser took in ~$400k, but how much of that went to the 2005 budget and how much is available for 2006? Also, I guess money is coming in from that partnership with Answers.com, but I don't know how to figure out how much revenue that has generated. --<a href="/wiki/User:Amcbride" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 16:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

Not criminal, just someone coming along and paying themselves $100,000 a year.

<p>According to Alexa over the last few days Wikipedia's traffic has fallen off a cliff. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;q=&amp;size=large&amp;range=6m&amp;url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">[16]</a> It says that the daily ranking was 30 on June 18, whereas it was between 12 and 20 every day in the previous five months. I haven't had any access problems or read of any and I can see no reason for this to have happened. Rates of article creation and edit frequency are normal. I think it is most likely an error by Alexa, but the page showing the rate of hits doesn't work any more. Does anyone have any explanations or comments? <a href="/wiki/User:Sumahoy" title="User:Sumahoy">Sumahoy</a> 02:30, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

They've changed their minds about the fall to 30th, and now it only went down to 19th, but the reach and pageview scores are still well down. I don't buy the World Cup explanation. The fall started very suddenly and well after the World Cup was underway. Anyway, Wikipedia covers the World Cup and it is generating a vast amount of edits. Also could Americans please remember that based on comScore stats, they account for well under a quarter of users, so they don't determine everything. Plus a majority of Wikipedia users are probably adults. I think they are having technical problems at Alexa's end. This has happened before, for example a few months back several Chinese sites that are normally in the top twenty fall into the thousands for two days. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:62.31.55.223&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:62.31.55.223 (page does not exist)">62.31.55.223</a> 02:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Yeah, Americans aren't counted - but the rest of the northern hemisphere ends their spring semesters about now too. For my part, this mean I suddenly had enough time to browse and edit wikipedia several hours per day, but that is not the case with most people, who are out enjoying the sun. (I'm allergic to the outside, I can't enjoy the damned sun.) Furthermore, I do think a quite substantial amount of the Wikipedians are young enough to be in at least secondary school or perhaps college/university, and as thus will have vacation now. Finally, quite a lot of working adults are on vacation now. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Jobj%C3%B6rn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jobjörn (page does not exist)">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jobj%C3%B6rn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jobjörn (page does not exist)">Talk</a> ° <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jobj%C3%83%C2%B6rn" title="Special:Contributions/JobjÃ¶rn">contribs</a>) 12:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>All patterns have random movements in them and one should wait a week to see what has happened. I believe I have seen a massive reduction in the number of articles recently, but that could be my memory. If content has dropped off due to edits THEN it is possible that there is less information here.:But if anyone cares the fact that Wikipedia is showing any drop at all during an explosion in Web 2.0 communities is a bad sign and if it is a trend it should be considered. This is the premier Open Source Web 2.0 project and right now Internet communities are exploding. Like it or not we are competing with Google, Yahoo, and other communities of informaiton here. If this thing goes Alta Vista it will give government and business the final excuse they need for entirely writing off Open Source, if readership does not double ever 4 months and we are not at 2 million articles by the end of summer the entire project will be in serious trouble of being drowned out by other for profit ventures, and with it the entire idea of Open Source as an alternative to business coding.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
