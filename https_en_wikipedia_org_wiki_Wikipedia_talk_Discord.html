<p>I wanna suggest a bot that'll help add roles to users, just for customization. Roles can include "rollbacker", "pending pages reviewer", etc.. You can use YAGPDB.xyz, a utility bot. Setting up custom roles is kinda tricky, but there is a tutorial vid on it.

</p><p>I brought this up today again and was sent the diff for this.&#160;:) I agree there should be roles for Rollbacker and pending pages, but also language proficiency, that can be added via bot. Ideally, the system would allow new roles to be added and configured quickly. (also if Wikibot's source is on GH then I could simply make a PR with the changes) - <a href="/wiki/User:VeryGoodDog" title="User:VeryGoodDog">VeryGoodDog</a> 21:36, 12 October 2019 (UTC)

<p>This section is for feedback regarding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Discord/Guidelines" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Discord/Guidelines">Wikipedia:Discord/Guidelines</a>, a tweaked and expanded version of the IRC guidelines to soon take effect as the rules for the Discord server. Much of the guidelines are taken straight from the IRC guidelines, with the language modernized (1-7). Several new bullets are added that deal with Discord specifically (7-11). Leave any feedback, questions or concerns you have here. Not every rule is expected to be popular and final decision will lie with the moderators and admins. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 17:55, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

<ul><li>I agree with all of these. A query about number 8 though - it's supposed to prevent impersonation, which is good. But does that mean that one can't just change their display name to something that's <i>not</i> already taken as a valid username on-wiki? For instance, can someone not have their display name as just "Shipping Container" without having their on-wiki username or nickname in their display name as well? Also, does number 9 mean that memes should not be spammed <i>except</i> in offtopic? <a href="/wiki/User:Epicgenius" title="User:Epicgenius">epicgenius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Epicgenius" title="User talk:Epicgenius">talk</a>) 18:03, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Nicknames should always make it clear who you are, whether by including your normal chat name or on-wiki username in some fashion. Nicknames have generated a lot of complaints lately. Keep in mind that the compact mode doesn't show avatars/profiles, so name changes can be even more confusing. As for memes, they shouldn't be excessively spammed anywhere. Offtopic is monitored more lightly but just back to back spam is a problem even there if it's disrupting the chat. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 18:09, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>I see, thanks. If I'm understanding correctly: nicknames or usernames should be incorporated into the display name in some fashion, and memes should be used only sparingly and only in offtopic if possible. Since Discord caters to a generally younger audience than IRC, I think that is a good tradeoff. <a href="/wiki/User:Epicgenius" title="User:Epicgenius">epicgenius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Epicgenius" title="User talk:Epicgenius">talk</a>) 18:12, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Thanks for the guidelines ferret, as we requested. I agree with all of this. But I am afraid I will have to trouble you with another question about the nickname guideline. Some people usually Susmuffin and Epicgenius impersonate k6ka and other "popular" Discord memebers, jokingly of course, by having a nickname like "Mr Pee Vilenski", "Probably k6ka", "Thicc genius".

<dl><dd><ul><li>True. I sort of figured that the point of the WikiAuthBot was to allow exactly this, a verifiable way to link your Discord to your Wikipedia account. I just don't really think it's a good assumption that someone's Discord name or nickname will match their on-wiki name. Unlike IRC where it's different per-server, your Discord account (and therefore your default nickname) is shared everywhere so it would probably be an undue burden to make them match. I wonder if WikiAuthBot could enforce a nickname policy where once you link a wiki account, it forces your nickname to always be that&#160;:) <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 20:08, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>FWIW strongly support a guideline to ensure names match (or at least include) Wikipedia usernames when the person does indeed have a Wikipedia account. It's persistently confusing/distracting to have to click people's names and/or search the wikiauthlog (more so when people take each other's names -- in friendliness, granted, but unless it's going to be a small private club that's not really great practice). On a someone separate note, I'd feel more comfortable if everyone were authenticated. Maybe it's worth exploring having a default help channel for people without an account and the rest only if authenticated? &#8212; <samp><a href="/wiki/User:Rhododendrites" title="User:Rhododendrites"><span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span></a> <sup style="font-size:80%;"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rhododendrites" title="User talk:Rhododendrites">talk</a></sup></samp> \\ 20:38, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>I might also make the Discord TOS part more explicit. I separately help manage a large public Discord so we've run against just about every possible thing that can go wrong. Discord places the burden on the owners of the server regarding following the TOS. For example, a friend of mine has a very active server with 7,000+ members, and he received a notification from Discord Trust and Safety that his server had content that violated the TOS within the last week. They did not say what was violating or where, the burden was on the Discord server to fix the problem. It might be worth emphasizing that infringing content can negatively impact the server on a whole, not just one user. One example is posting NSFW: Discord's TOS allows users between 13 and 18 to use the service, but also requires that any NSFW be posted in channels marked as NSFW, which brings up an additional menu requiring you to confirm you're 18+. Posting NSFW in non-NSFW marked channels, without moderators quickly removing it, can put the whole server at risk. So this part should be emphasized more. Also, Discord TOS does forbid any form of doxing / personal information already, as well as a laundry list of other unexpectedly prohibited behaviors (e.g. discussing cheating in video games). It might be worth adding stronger language that guides users towards reading the Discord TOS before doing anything sketchy. <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 19:52, 28 July 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Also we need a modbot to set temporary bans/mute for punishment for less severe cases. A Discord server mute is done through assigning a Muted role on Discord which explicitly denies the permission to send messages in all channels effectively muting them like in voice channels. You can do it manually or have a modbot do it for you for convenience. Also, it would be nice to have a public modlogs channel like IRC ban list as we have seen a recent increase of trolls and NOTHERE in the server. Thoughts on this everyone? I personally don't see any reason for not making mod logs public. I am not asking for "audit log" to be public because it might contain other server related changes besides mod log.

<p>Hello,
</p><p>I think it should be made clear at the top of the page attached to this talk page that Discord is <a href="/wiki/Proprietary_software" title="Proprietary software">non-libre software</a>, not endorsed by the Wikimedia Foundation or aligned with its goals, that there is no way to know exactly what it does once installed, and that it is known to collect data on its users. Obviously, it needs to be worded better than that, but does anyone have any objections to this proposal?

<dl><dd>I feel it's a deliberate negative spin. Users can make their own determinations on what software they like to use. The same can be said about IRC in regards to various different clients having unknown functionality after being installed (Let's not fool ourselves, most editors are not programmers and can't verify an open source project, and bunches of them aren't open source anyway), and the ability to collect data, as well as no WMF endorsement or strict alignment with goals, not any true guarantee that the network is being ran responsibly (See, Freenode). The page already denoted that it's an unofficial server. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 12:25, 25 June 2021 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>I'm not interested in this, I am not an adherent or advocate of libre philosophy.

<dl><dd>DesertPipeline, that would be a very broad area for consideration and doesn't really belong here - it would also be, in policy terms, UNDUE. The nature of your opening comment "[not] aligned with its goals" is also concerning - there's no reason anyone would think they were.

<p>I've seen this page being linked in a few places like the Teahouse. I'm not very comfortable with that. Please can we continue this discussion on adding a suitable warning to this page so that new people on Wikipedia aren't being introduced to Discord here without any warning about its nature? <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 07:30, 9 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a>, I'm not sure what you mean - there is now a clear notice at the top of the page stating that as an external service isn't not subject to the WMF Privacy Policy. <a href="/wiki/User:Firefly" title="User:Firefly"><span style="color:#850808;">firefly</span></a> <small>( <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Firefly" title="User talk:Firefly">t</a> · <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Firefly" title="Special:Contributions/Firefly">c</a> )</small> 07:34, 9 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Firefly" title="User:Firefly">User:Firefly</a>: The notice currently at the top of the page that you mention isn't, in my opinion, something that would make anyone pause and think "should I <i>really</i> use this?", which is what we want to make them think. I mean no offence to the Wikipedia community on Discord, but if you're going to set up a server on a proprietary communication protocol which is collecting data on its users for a website which is supposed to be against such things, against unethical technology and all its ills, then you have to clearly explain to people what they're getting themselves into if they want to join you. There needs to be a newly-written warning which incorporates the current box's text (so you don't need two boxes) but which concisely and clearly explains the nature of Discord. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 07:45, 9 July 2021 (UTC)

Wikimedia has its own individual goals, which may align with the wider free/libre software movement in some areas, but are not obliged to align in all. Users are free to make their own judgment about what software they do or do not use, and a warning of the kind you want would be giving undue weight to a specific point of view in my opinion. <a href="/wiki/User:Firefly" title="User:Firefly"><span style="color:#850808;">firefly</span></a> <small>( <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Firefly" title="User talk:Firefly">t</a> · <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Firefly" title="Special:Contributions/Firefly">c</a> )</small> 08:02, 9 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Firefly" title="User:Firefly">User:Firefly</a>: You're right that users are free to make their own judgement. But they should be able to make an informed judgement. That's the only reason I'm requesting this; so that anyone who comes here without initially knowing what Discord is is given the opportunity to make an informed decision, rather than simply going in "blind" so to speak. I've written a first draft for a possible warning on the page, although I think maybe the privacy policy bullet point may be unnecessary now. What do you think? I'm not sure about the wording right now. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 08:07, 9 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Discord's privacy policy is better than most companies', tbh, and I don't think they really misuse data. Of course, the use of any website external to Wikipedia is subject to different privacy policies. When you click on a link on a ref, you could go to some malicious site. Links on user profiles, ditto (especially links to personally-controlled web pages, which basically can be used to get specific Wikipedians' IPs). We're not going to start putting up disclaimers everywhere, right? <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 11:18, 9 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nosebagbear" title="User:Nosebagbear">User:Nosebagbear</a>: So why do you feel it is not a significant threat, nor non-obvious?

<dl><dd>Firstly, we haven't seen any indication of individuals who have so little awareness on the Discord that they didn't know it was private software before clicking on the invite link. Secondly, your reasoning for why libre software is safer wouldn't hold-up if individuals are the type of blindly join a platform they certainly would neither be the type to utilise an ability to check over the information available for libre software - or even care about that not being the case for private software. I don't believe it's a significant threat because there's no indication that Discord's software has done things it shouldn't do, nor is that likely to change in the near future. It's not obvious because I don't see any indication that users are joining Discord without awareness that it's a company using proprietary source code. <a href="/wiki/User:Nosebagbear" title="User:Nosebagbear">Nosebagbear</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nosebagbear" title="User talk:Nosebagbear">talk</a>) 13:37, 9 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nosebagbear" title="User:Nosebagbear">User:Nosebagbear</a>: Regarding your usage of the term "private software": that isn't a related concept. Software is "private" when only certain people can get copies; it may or may not be libre.</dd>
<dd>Regarding "libre software is safer": that's not what I'm saying. There is certainly the opportunity for the community around a piece of software to verify that it's safe to use (and fix it if it's not) if it's libre software; no such opportunity exists with non-libre software, of course. That doesn't mean it is automatically, but at least you're not required to merely trust the developers.</dd>
<dd>Regarding "it hasn't done things it shouldn't": well, it collects data on people. It sells that data. It can determine what else is running on a computer it's running on. It automatically updates itself with no option to go back to, or continue using, a previous version. I would say that all of these things are things it shouldn't do. And of course, this is only what we know it does. That's the problem with non-libre software: you can't possibly know exactly what it's doing.</dd>
<dd>In fact, I think I'm being too lenient on it by not mentioning the fact that it knows what else is running on a computer it's running on in the notice. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 13:46, 9 July 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Addendum: Essentially all the notice is saying is that it's unrelated to Wikipedia and the WMF, it's not possible to know what it does, and messages are stored on their servers unencrypted. I think these are reasonable things to inform people about before they decide to use it. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 14:36, 9 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Opposed</b> I gave my views before, and Firefly and Nosebagbear have re-iterated, but if I don't say something it'll be taken as silent assent. Whether it's "technically" true or not, this amounts to a kind of "smear campaign" on non-libre software. The ultimate goal and drive is a scare tactic. Barring any major controversy or issue with Discord's privacy rules, it's UNDUE. And it's not even true per se. The line about end-to-end encryption is patently fear mongering. While true it's not end-to-end encrypted, to state all messages can be intercepted? No, it's still encrypted in transit to and from Discord. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 12:42, 9 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">User:Ferret</a>: It's not a scare tactic; it's allowing for an informed decision to be made, rather than not telling anyone anything about what they're about to get themselves into.

<dd>The purpose of encryption is to prevent people who shouldn't be able to see a message from seeing it. For instance, in a public chat room, the messages should be encrypted so that only people in the room can read a message. If you join the server, you'll be able to see the messages. The intent is to stop those running the communication system from just pulling data from all rooms/channels/etc running on the communication system because the messages are stored on the communication system maintainer's servers either unencrypted or encrypted with a key the maintainer knows. It also means that people can't just crack into the communication system's servers and gather information from it. Obviously, in a public room, someone can just join and copy the messages&#160;&#8211;&#32;but that's no reason to not use encryption so that anyone who doesn't can't just get the data anyway. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 10:20, 10 July 2021 (UTC)

<dd>I absolutely doubt their practice. Because it's impossible for me to verify what they're doing. Blind trust is a bad thing. Also, statements that are true are not "scaremongering". They can and do read messages that you send and receive via the communication system. That's what happens when you communicate via a communication system which doesn't encrypt your messages with a key only you know&#160;&#8211;&#32;you essentially give them permission to spy on you.

<dd>I don't know the specifics of encryption, but anyone who joined the server would be sent the key so they can read messages. Like I said, it doesn't prevent Discord staff from joining the server themselves and storing all messages sent in the server that way, but at least it's not "the messages are stored on Discord's servers without encryption, or with encryption with a key that Discord knows". Personally I would say that peer-to-peer communication is better, because it eliminates trusting a central server. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 02:57, 11 July 2021 (UTC)

<p>I've been watching this for a few days and I <b>oppose</b> points 2 and 3. DesertPipeline said <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">I will not respond to anything which goes off the topic (examples: [...] debating whether or not Discord upholds its word...)</span>, I say that imposes unreasonable constraints on this discussion because it appears to take out of the discussion the improbability of Discord misusing personal data. We are not simply going off Discord's word here, it is California state law that mandates that consumer data should not be shared. This is different from a <i>person</i> asking to be taken at their word - when a person fails to keep their word, they lose trust; when a corporation breaks the law, its employees lose not only trust but money, reputation, livelihood and possibly also personal freedom. 
</p><p>DesertPipeline admits freely that this template is intended as a "warning". Usually we <i>warn</i> people about probable - not <i>possible</i>, <i>probable</i> - dangers they have no idea about. This is because a situation can have infinite possible bad outcomes, making listing the improbable ones out a pointless exercise; besides, people on the internet generally do have an idea that software online can track their actions. Given that Discord apparently has no record - even alleged - of selling user data or, indeed, being malicious in any other way, I see no reason to add this disclaimer. It is not useful to readers; it may scare them unreasonably. It is no different from the tactic used by apps and websites to say "Critical functions of this service may not work!!11!!!1!" when you deny them device/cookie permissions.
</p><p>If we implement DesertPipeline's philosophy of warning readers of the worst-case scenarios of literally anything and everything, no matter how improbable, we should not only start adding templates similar to theirs to all external links, but start warning people that:

<dl><dd><small>Sigh, I have poor resolve...</small></dd>
<dd>DesertPipeline, you <b>fundamentally misunderstand</b> why Discord stores messages in full on its servers. You are blinded by your determination to see monsters in the shadows.</dd>
<dd>Others have already told you why Discord does store messages: to enable new joinees to read the entire chat history. I think you do not comprehend the scale of what this means, and why this is advantageous compared to end-to-end encryption in the case of mass communication.</dd>
<dd>On services like WhatsApp with end-to-end encryption, all messages have to be stored locally, somewhere on the user's device or cloud storage, to be read. This consumes device space and Internet data. This is famously not the case on Discord. I am on ten Discord servers, five of them have upwards of 700 messages - ~5% of them being multimedia - posted on them each day. The fact that the messages are stored by Discord, and not by me, means that I do not have to download and store locally 3500 messages per day, most of which I won't read. If I want to see server history on a large server, I do not have to download millions of messages. If someone sends me an image, I do not have to download it to see it. If someone posts a video, I do not have to download it to see it. This is a well-known, well-appreciated feature of Discord.</dd>
<dd>This is by design and has been so since Discord's founding. It is not <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #006400;">an unnecessary and harmful societal practice which has no possible benefits, yet goes unchallenged by the population at large.</span> This is understood by everyone here except, probably, you; this is why this proposal of yours has no support and this is why everyone is being sharp-tongued with you - they have explained all that is there to be explained, yet you <i>do not listen</i> and remain stubbornly stuck to your own peculiar and unfounded beliefs of why Discord is the way it is. <a href="/wiki/User:Wilhelm_Tell_DCCXLVI" title="User:Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI">Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wilhelm_Tell_DCCXLVI" title="User talk:Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI">converse</a> &#124; <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Wilhelm_Tell_DCCXLVI" title="Special:Contributions/Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI">fings wot i hav dun</a></sup> 03:39, 13 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Apologies, but hey, I did refute that unencrypted communication is a foolish idea.</dd>
<dd>Now, I think it is fairly nonsensical to expect a for-profit company recently valued at $10 billion to release the source code of its sole product, enabling knockoffs with cheaper Nitro to proliferate.

<dl><dd>Sure. I'd say I have enough AGF left to explain that. We absolutely should not warn people about what is technically possible. Not as a general rule.

There is no way for us to know, but, it's possible that requesting this next page COULD cause a data overage for you, costing you money!". We should not put that hentai warning that I mentioned above on Wikimedia Commons (that one's easy per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED">WP:NOTCENSORED</a>).</dd>
<dd>Whether something is worth warning about, is a separate concept from if it's technically possible. We shouldn't warn people about impossibilities, and indeed, we also shouldn't warn them about something that's exceedingly unlikely. See <a href="/wiki/Alarm_fatigue" title="Alarm fatigue">alarm fatigue</a>, it's a real thing. A sad fact of human psychology, if you want to think of it as such.</dd>
<dd><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">the communication system operators can read the message without me ever knowing</q> With respect to this, it is technically true, but it is implausible to worry about. In order for this to truly be on your mind, I imagine you would have to be interrogating every individual account that joined the Discord server "prove to me that you have a Wikipedia account! Prove to me that you're a Wiki editor and not a bot funneling information to an advertising company! I will not say a single word further in this server until you prove your identity". This is a little silly. My point is that it's not worth worrying about, because the scenario in which that worry bears fruit is completely implausible.</dd>
<dd>I actually think it would be unchanged in a p2p setting? Assuming that we still maintain the property that anyone can join the network and read all the history, any advertiser or data miner or AI researcher or otherwise interested third party is already allowed to download the entire message history without needing permission...? It is a little strange that in the context of p2p, the worry of nefarious actors reading the messages disappears. Why would it disappear? My entire point is that Discord's position as the operators of the communication system does <i>not</i> grant them any additional abilities or permissions to read messages, than the general public. Therefore, there is no concern about their behavior, at all. <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 04:50, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">User:Leijurv</a>: Okay; your points about the Wikipedia chat room on Discord are fair. However, this warning would serve a general purpose. There are surely people out there who don't use Discord and don't know anything about it&#160;&#8211;&#32;and encouraging them to start using it means they could use it for purposes other than Wikipedia communication; they may think that they are communicating privately in a small chat room with friends when actually Discord staff are able to see their messages. This is the main problem. I don't really like that we have a Wikipedia page encouraging people to use software which mistreats them. At least if we tell them that it does, they might think critically about it rather than going in blindly. Like I said, all I want people to be is informed. Informed choices are better than uninformed choices. If they decide they want to use Discord despite the risks, that's their choice&#160;&#8211;&#32;but you wouldn't encourage someone to go bungee jumping without clearly explaining the risks first, would you? <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 04:57, 11 July 2021 (UTC)

Of course, you are correct that there is no way to be sure that Discord staff do not read some otherwise-private messages, separately from the Wikipedia community. If that is now your worry, that users will venture beyond the Wikipedia Discord and into other incorrectly-presumed-private spaces, I call that advocacy. It's above and beyond, excessive, to warn people about that. Also a bit of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTCENSORED">WP:NOTCENSORED</a>, about how Wikipedia tends towards not putting warnings by links, images, citations, pages.

<dl><dd>You can go and write an essay on the harms of Discord. But the <i>project page</i> on Discord is subject to consensus. I have heard your arguments on this matter and I think that <a href="/wiki/Alarm_fatigue" title="Alarm fatigue">alarm fatigue</a> makes the warning as proposed counterproductive or misleading or both. At most, such topics could be covered in the body. I believe that the current such coverage in the body is sufficient for us to sleep easy knowing that we have done our moral duty in warning potential users of the Wikipedia Discord, regarding who will be able to read their messages. I won't comment on <a href="/wiki/Discord_(software)" title="Discord (software)">Discord (software)</a>, a page with independent consensus to here, except to say that it's perfectly possible that it provides more privacy than another service (I'm sure we'd agree that we'd rather use Discord than WeChat). <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 05:16, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">User:Leijurv</a>: I've read through this page before and I don't agree that it does enough to warn people about Discord.

<dl><dd>I can't really reply in full without doing a lot of repeating myself. So, in short: I believe that the risk presented to the average reader, the average Wikipedian, who joins Discord and participates in the Wiki community on there, is essentially nonexistent. It is so small, that adding such a warning about it would constitute <a href="/wiki/Alarm_fatigue" title="Alarm fatigue">alarm fatigue</a> and be counterproductive. <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 05:29, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">User:Leijurv</a>: From your perspective the risk is essentially nonexistent; but you're confusing "essentially nonexistent risk" with "extremely prevalent but well-hidden risk". If the risks were obvious, the warning wouldn't be necessary. From the perspective of someone about to be run over by a reversing car without any backing-up sound, there's essentially nonexistent risk too; except in this case, there's often not even a point where someone even feels the effect, and so they continue doing what harms them without ever realising it is harming them. Also, I'm not sure how alarm fatigue applies in this context, honestly. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 05:34, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A warning about a triviality will make someone disregard the warning, and perhaps future similar warnings. We don't want that. I'm not saying it's obvious I'm saying it's trivial (i.e. tiny risk). <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 05:36, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">User:Leijurv</a>: But it's not trivial. That's the point. Just because you don't see the harmful effects, it doesn't mean they aren't there. If you remained in an area with a radiation leak you wouldn't feel the effects until it was too late; but there's no analogy that can convey what happens in this case properly, because, so long as you don't go looking for it, you'll probably never find out that you're being harmed. That makes it even worse, and it's why it's even more important that we actually make people think about it rather than just letting them go into it blindly. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 05:40, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The risk of otherwise-private communications being read by third parties like Discord is trivial, as I argued above (I thought you agreed?). The risk of the Discord server-side software misbehaving is similarly discounted, because there's nothing that Discord can do that any old person couldn't. Again because the server is public.</dd>
<dd>I wonder, would you suggest that a store selling stamps should have a warning <i><b>There is no way to know for sure that postal workers aren't reading your mail!</b></i> <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 05:44, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">User:Leijurv</a>: Letters are different to digital communication; but I do think that people should be informed about that danger, too (so they can try to enact changes which mitigate the risk). Also, I don't remember agreeing to what you said. What is your definition of "trivial"? As in, you think they likely won't do it, or you think that when they do it, it's a trivial problem? <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 05:51, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ok, that is funny to hear, that you essentially agree that that warning should exist. Never mind that it's a felony and there is data that it is essentially never happens. <i>There's a point where something is so unlikely that it's counterproductive to bring it up.</i></dd>
<dd>Ok, maybe I made a wrong assumption. It was based of when you said <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Okay; your points about the Wikipedia chat room on Discord are fair.</q> My point has been simple: the fact that the Wikipedia space on Discord is fully public is an automatic negation of a number of possible complaints or issues. There is no longer any possible reason to worry about misbehavior on the part of Discord. We might just as easily worry about Discord going out, scraping onwiki communications, and mishandling those - both are equally public. For this reason, the risk presented by communicating in the Wikipedia space on Discord is zero, I cannot think of any. Other than your moral complaint about how Discord is itself a proprietary program, I suppose. <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 05:58, 11 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Okay so this has moved away from "inform users about a real, tangible risk that they face" and towards "I morally disagree with essentially the entire modern Internet".</dd>
<dd>For example, if the risk was "someone can read messages that you would believe are private", then sure I can see how exposing that information is something that should be warned about, such as if Discord had a history of such behavior, or had a bad reputation like that.</dd>
<dd>But your concern is simply that users are.... browsing to a website that doesn't <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html">mark its JavaScript as free software</a> so that your <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/index.html">LibreJS</a> browser extension can recognize it? That's &gt;99.99% of all websites on the entire internet. We, as a society, have determined that this is okay. You disagree. This doesn't give you moral authority to suggest that the act of executing software that one cannot enact their four essential freedoms against, is somehow morally perverse and something to be warned against.

<dl><dd>It would be infantilizing to put a message like "if you use Discord as a website, it can't really do anything to harm you, at all. but if you download it as a program, look out! you can't really know that it isn't messing with your computer!". Not our place to walk people through basic functionality of the internet versus a downloaded program.

<p>Something I would like to mention that I found interesting is how, during this discussion, as it became clear to some participants that the assessment of risk was incorrect, rather than analysing the risk objectively, they "upgraded" it just enough to continue to remain comfortable. "There's no risk" → "The risk is minimal" → "They can do these things, but it's unlikely they will". From my perspective I believe this is some sort of defence mechanism. I believe that other participants in this discussion are made uncomfortable by my points, because they know&#160;&#8211;&#32;subconsciously&#160;&#8211;&#32;that they are true, but feel there isn't anything that can be done. Therefore, to prevent themselves from feeling extreme mental discomfort due to this, their brains must defend something that could still plausibly apply. 
</p><p>Obviously, "there's no risk" is the point of highest comfort; at that point, nothing is wrong in their conscious minds, so everything is good&#160;&#8211;&#32;no changes necessary, everything can continue "as normal". But then when there is no way their subconscious can continue defending this stance, they have to then go a little lower down the "comfort chain" so to speak&#160;&#8211;&#32;the risk is minimal. Sure, maybe a risk exists, but it's small. It's fine. Nothing needs to be changed still&#160;&#8211;&#32;there are always risks in life, right? Then, however, we come to a point where actual discomfort sets in. It is now clear that the risks <i>aren't</i> minimal. Even though this is the point of actual discomfort, they actually come to the easiest-to-defend stance&#160;&#8211;&#32;the risk exists, but it's unlikely they'll do the things they have the capability to do. This one causes actual discomfort because they must now acknowledge that there is a non-insignificant risk. But there is still no change in behaviour prompted, because there is always plausible deniability&#160;&#8211;&#32;because of the nature of the problem, it usually isn't possible to say for certain whether or not a certain entity <i>is</i> abusing its power.
</p><p>But the fact of the matter is that the power they have is problem one. There isn't any legitimate reason for the developers of Discord to have control over the copies of the software others possess. There isn't any legitimate reason for any software developer to have that power. There are only two possible scenarios: 1. The developer doesn't abuse their power, and therefore doesn't need it (but keeping it allows them to change their mind at any point and start abusing it). 2. The developer <i>does</i> abuse their power, and therefore shouldn't have it. There isn't any context in software where a developer of a program should have control over the copies of others. 
</p><p>And that people allow such a thing is, in my mind, very strange. If you bought a car, would you accept the car manufacturer saying "You may have bought that car, but it's ours. We made it. Therefore, we get to tell you what you can and can't do with it. You're also not allowed to know how it works. If it breaks, you have to hope we'll fix it. If it has some malicious function, then you'll just have to accept that or stop using the car&#160;&#8211;&#32;if you ever even notice, because maybe the malicious function is hidden." I hope that people here see how that would be an insane scenario. The same logic applies to software too.
</p><p>Therefore, to warn people that someone else will have control over something you want to use, and that they have no legitimate reason to control it and can only ever use that control maliciously, is surely not unreasonable. Let them know the risks. Let them make an informed decision.
</p><p>We all have an obligation to be ethical, good people. Some people refuse that obligation&#160;&#8211;&#32;like non-libre software developers. For our own sake, we need to offset the damage they cause as much as possible. What is happening right now helps them. Sometimes, even if you don't think you're directly helping something negative, you're still helping. Sometimes, you have to do good to offset bad. That's all I'm asking we do. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 04:04, 12 July 2021 (UTC)

What kind of logic is it to say "If someone else says something you disagree with, you can't try to refute their argument because that would be bludgeoning"? This is how a good discussion works. But other participants in the discussion need to listen to what I'm saying; I'm trying to listen to what they're saying and responding to their points whenever I can. That's how we improve.

<dd>DesertPipeline, you're still talking as if nothing I've said has gotten through. For the Wikipedia Discord, which is what we are concerned with here, Discord-the-company has <b>no</b> additional access or information beyond the general public. They have no ability to leak personal communications or otherwise misuse them, because there are no personal communications. It's all very intentionally accessible to everyone. Can you explain why you are still going on about how we need to worry about Discord doing such a thing? Additionally, when you refer to the concern that Discord will somehow someday insert malicious code into their website: that concern is equally as large on Wikipedia itself, since both are client-server applications and not peer to peer. I don't think it's reasonable to warn someone about something that's already the case on Wikipedia. <a href="/wiki/User:Leijurv" title="User:Leijurv">Leijurv</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Leijurv" title="User talk:Leijurv">talk</a>) 20:45, 12 July 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>My point was that you're switching between a quite weak and a quite strong statement as it suits your argument at the moment, which is called a <a href="/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy" title="Motte-and-bailey fallacy">motte-and-bailey fallacy</a>. The prescriptive moral statement ("quite strong") is not to be included, per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RGW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RGW">WP:RGW</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ADVOCACY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ADVOCACY">WP:ADVOCACY</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SOAP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>.

<dd>The page is encouraging them to use Discord. It's unlikely they'll only use Discord to communicate in the Wikipedia chat room. If you introduce someone to something harmful they need to be aware of the risks. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 10:31, 14 July 2021 (UTC)

<dd>Why are they not sufficiently aware of the risk by clicking the links like "proprietary" and "Discord"? Why is the big orange box a determining factor?

Also, if this were to be integrated into the project page's text rather than being a box at the top, the "join server" button needs to be made less prominent. It should also be below the caveats, so that hopefully people will read those first and <i>then</i> decide whether or not to use Discord. <a href="/wiki/User:DesertPipeline" title="User:DesertPipeline">DesertPipeline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DesertPipeline" title="User talk:DesertPipeline">talk</a>) 04:27, 15 July 2021 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the way private chats are sent to Discord servers, it occurs to me the page may need to explicitly state something to the effect of "don't use this to discuss sensitive information about Wikipedia users, even in private chats". It's easy to forget that even if you switch to a private message to, say, discuss something with an admin/arb/oversighter, that's probably still inappropriate to send via Discord. I'm just thinking about a central point of failure for a large amount of private information. Thoughts? &#8212; <samp><a href="/wiki/User:Rhododendrites" title="User:Rhododendrites"><span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span></a> <sup style="font-size:80%;"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rhododendrites" title="User talk:Rhododendrites">talk</a></sup></samp> \\ 14:44, 9 July 2021 (UTC)

<dd>'Sensitive information' is sent over IRC private chats, as well. Arguably it shouldn't be done on any offwiki platform, but maybe we should implement some rules for the <i>storage</i> of information first (eg there is nothing even requiring CUOS to store their notes on WMF private wikis; they can store them on Google Drive or their desktop for all policy says). <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 15:08, 9 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>How is this any different than an e-mail, text message, paper letter or any other messaging platform? It all goes through third party services to transit from the sender to the receiver, there are a dozen points where the "privacy" could be compromised -- from someone reading over a shoulder, to a physical device being compromised, to the ISP and/or nation-state collecting traffic data, to the messaging service being compromised and/or willingly selling data, and double those same risks at the receiving end. Would this page, along with <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EMAIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EMAIL">WP:EMAIL</a>, need a warning to users that "<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">anything not whispered quietly into another person's ear or transmitted telepathically may be intercepted or leaked by third parties</q>"?

<p>Can anyone provide more details on how the authentication process works? Is there a need to trust the WikiAuthBot? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Isaacl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Isaacl (page does not exist)">isaacl</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Isaacl" title="User talk:Isaacl">talk</a>) 20:42, 10 July 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>What do you mean by "trust the WikiAuthBot"? The bot's method of authentication is <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:OAuth" class="extiw" title="mw:Help:OAuth">WMF OAuth</a>, which it was approved to use. The bot is ran by <a href="/wiki/User:IVORK" title="User:IVORK">User:IVORK</a> and is also verified with Discord. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 20:51, 10 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>All this page says is to follow the instructions provided by WikiAuthBot, so I don't know how the process works. If someone could provide a description, it would be helpful to understand ahead of time how security is maintained. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Isaacl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Isaacl (page does not exist)">isaacl</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Isaacl" title="User talk:Isaacl">talk</a>) 20:54, 10 July 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>When you send the message ".auth" in a channel, the bot will direct message you an authentication link. This link will take you to the WMF website and tell you what application (WikiAuthBot) wants to know about your account and what it will be allowed to do. You allow or deny it. If you allow it, WMF tells the bot that you did so, and you are authenticated. This information is also at <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Discord#WikiAuthBot" class="extiw" title="meta:Discord">WikiAuthBot</a> which the page links to. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Ferret" title="User:Ferret">ferret</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ferret" title="User talk:Ferret">talk</a>) 20:56, 10 July 2021 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>How the bot's flow works is it uses a general OAuth flow (I'm guessing you're familiar with it), which allows a user to log in on meta.wikimedia.org with their Wikimedia account to authorise the bot's application. Effectively, if there's a successful grant then the bot knows you have control of the Wikimedia account and then gives you a role. You can see a demo flow at <a class="external free" href="https://oauth-hello-world.toolforge.org">https://oauth-hello-world.toolforge.org</a> (ran by Anomie).</dd>
<dd>The bot is unofficial (ie, not ran by the WMF) and hosted by a community member, so naturally you have to trust the bot and its operator. Whether an OAuth flow even happens is up to the operator, and they're the only person who can verify an OAuth actually happened. They <i>could</i> (ie, they have the technical ability to do it) give a Discord user an 'authentication' of being Isaacl without that user actually being you, and nobody else can verify that. The authentication is effectively just IVORK vouching for the Wikipedia identity of a Discord user.</dd>
<dd>In terms of grants, WikiAuthBot only asks for <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">permission to access information on all projects of this site on your behalf. No changes will be made with your account.</q> (which I <i>presume</i> is the least invasive grant possible). <a href="/wiki/User:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User:ProcrastinatingReader">ProcrastinatingReader</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ProcrastinatingReader" title="User talk:ProcrastinatingReader">talk</a>) 21:04, 10 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

The grant it uses is the least invasive possible and was approved for purpose by Stewards. The bot being verified by Discord (&amp; I having the Verified Bot Developer badge), means that Discord has photo ID of my real identity. I also run other bots, some of which generate income, this all means that misuse of one would mean loss of all &amp; that I'm legally vulnerable to the actions of my bots. Finally, the bot &amp; OAuth redirect is hosted on <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Toolforge" class="extiw" title="wikitech:Portal:Toolforge">Toolforge</a> &amp; therefor open source to those that need it.</dd>
<dd>In terms of the literal process, upon typing <code>.auth</code>, my bot reaches out to the appropriate Wikimedia API (I split it to the language appropriate wiki for the server the command was used on) and open an OAuth 'ticket' which gives back a unique URL, this is passed onto the user, if they log into an account &amp; hit accept within a period of time, they'll be redirected with token arguments to my Toolforge endpoint, the bot receives these, uses the tokens to pull the UserID from the Wikimedia API as well as gender if relevant to the language equivalent of <code>User:</code> &amp; finally assigns roles/posts messages for all guilds the user is in. I only store the on-wiki name of the user against their Discord ID, I don't store the tokens. So even with the read access being granted, it is not persistent access currently. Although I may change that last part due to it meaning users changing names can't be resolved automatically.  — <span style="text-shadow:red 0em 0em 0.8em"><a href="/wiki/User:IVORK" title="User:IVORK"><b style="font-family:Ariel; color:red">IVORK</b></a></span> <sub><a href="/wiki/User_talk:IVORK" title="User talk:IVORK"><b style="font-family:Ariel; color:Green; font-size:x-small">Talk</b></a></sub> 23:27, 11 July 2021 (UTC)
