<h2><span id="Removal_of_destinations_of_airlines.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Removal_of_destinations_of_airlines?">Removal of destinations of airlines?</span></h2>
<p>At <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ANI" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ANI">WP:ANI</a> I had previously filed a case about <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">User:*AirportUpdater*</a>. (My IP has changed) But the disscussion got to taking the destination lists away from articles, most of these editors were unfamiliar with this project. I dissagree, but first, lets try and generate consensus. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233" title="Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233">87.112.66.233</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:87.112.66.233&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:87.112.66.233 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:52, 23 October 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>My opinion: I think the destination lists should most certainly be kept. The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is the only place that lists the destinations of airports, yet, some airports have reached GA status. Here are some examlples:
</p><p>A planespotter wants to choose the best airport to planespot from, he has a choice of Gatwick or Heathrow. He looks on the internet for spots, then comes here to find out what airlines go there. He in the end, chooses the airport with the most airlines.
</p><p>What would happen without the destination lists? <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233" title="Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233">87.112.66.233</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:87.112.66.233&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:87.112.66.233 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:01, 23 October 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>I strongly disagree that destination tables should be removed. The airlines and destinations served are some of the most important and significant pieces of information about an airport and the table format is the easiest and simplest format to display this information in. People keep citing WP:NOTGUIDEBOOK to argue that they should be removed, but I don't see how information about airlines and destinations constitutes a travel guide in any way, as it is not presented for the purpose of helping people book flights, but is instead supposed to give information about the operation and function of the airport. How can an article provide a thorough overview of an airport without showing which airlines it is served by and which destinations they fly to? Many editors are also saying they should be removed because they constantly require updating; but as long as there is a sufficient group of editors who are willing to do this, then how is this an issue? The WP:Airports community is, in good faith, attempting to keep the airport articles detailed, accurate and up-to-date, and inevitably there will be some editors who see this as pointless or meaningless, but that doesn't mean the information doesn't deserve to be on Wikipedia. Ultimately, having airport articles without listing the airlines and destinations would be like having sports team articles without listing the players; although some people would consider the articles to be 'complete' without them, the article would be severely lacking in context and would be missing the most relevant and meaningful information about the subject.
As for the issue of citations in destination tables, this is probably something that needs to be discussed and consensus reached, because it is currently very inconsistent between individual articles. <a href="/wiki/User:OakleighPark" title="User:OakleighPark">Oakleigh</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:OakleighPark" title="User talk:OakleighPark">Park</a> 12:29, 23 October 2015 (UTC)

List of each airlines' destinations: changes frequently, impossibly bulky, hard to source (probably requiring primary sources), and leads to arguments about whether a change of flight number at some intermediate stop means there is or is not service from Foobar International to Melbourne.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>These articles are grossly overdetailed in many places. Example:
<dl><dd><i>At the time of its completion, the JFK tower, at 320 feet (97.5m), was the world's tallest control tower. It was subsequently displaced from that position by towers at other airports in both the United States and overseas, including those at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, currently the tallest tower at any U.S. airport, at 398 feet (121.3m) and at Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, currently the world's tallest control tower at 434 feet (132.2m).</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Nothing after the first sentence serves the reader's understanding of JFK airport. (In an article on a warship, gun statistics tell us something about strategic positioning of nations. But airports don't move around and fire at one another from their towers...) It's fancruft. <a href="/wiki/User:EEng" title="User:EEng">EEng</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:EEng" title="User talk:EEng">talk</a>) 13:58, 23 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Oh, and look! Let's suppose I want to know about <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_International_Airport" title="Pittsburgh International Airport">Pittsburgh_International_Airport</a>. I'll be more than well informed about <i>every aspect</i> of its current and past facilities in the minutest detail. For example:
<dl><dd><i>American Airlines has its Admirals Club on the mezzanine level of the airside terminal. It is accessible by escalators in the center core area. Before a post-9/11 restructure of routes (effectively dehubbing Pittsburgh), US Airways had three clubs. The other two clubs were located on the upper levels of the A and B terminals. British Airways also had a lounge area in the C terminal during their transatlantic flight operations from Pittsburgh (1980s to fall 1999). Their lounge room is still there intact but now closed off.</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Yes, that's what the reader needs to know -- the former locations of now-closed clubs by an airline that doesn't even exist anymore. It's hard to believe the bit about escalators isn't conscious self-parody, but apparently it really is not. <a href="/wiki/User:EEng" title="User:EEng">EEng</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:EEng" title="User talk:EEng">talk</a>) 15:41, 23 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Sarcastic statements like this are not constructive, nor are broad criticisms of the editors in this WikiProject. You can't attribute every single statement on every single airport article to this WikiProject; the majority of WP:Airport editors would probably agree that the sentence about the escalators should be removed as it is unnecessary information, so criticising the entire Wikiproject over it is unnecessary. Additionally, just because 'you' don't see the relevance or significance of a certain piece of information, it doesn't mean it isn't relevant or significant; the tallest airport control tower is definitely worthy of a mention in an article, as are the airlines and destinations served from the airport. It appears as though the majority of editors demanding that destination tables be removed have very little understanding of either the Wikiproject or the subject matter, and their demands for removal seem to be based on personal preference instead of objective analysis of whether it is notable or not. <a href="/wiki/User:OakleighPark" title="User:OakleighPark">Oakleigh</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:OakleighPark" title="User talk:OakleighPark">Park</a> 23:29, 23 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>No, these sarcastic comments are highly constructive, because they bring into laserlike focus the bizarre amount of fancruft in these articles. I didn't have to look around for the stuff about Admiral Clubs -- my eye just fell on it. Everywhere one looks one sees similar nonsense.</dd>
<dd>Yes, the tallest tower is worth mentioning. Even the fact that it was the tallest <i>at the time of construction</i> is worth mentioning. What's not worth mentioning is the names and heights of two other towers (one domestic, one foreign) which have rendered it <i>no longer</i> the tallest tower. Here's what that passage should say:
<dl><dd><i>JFK's 320-foot (97.5 m) tower was the world's tallest for XX years.</i></dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd>I don't think that many people would consider information about airlines and destinations to be 'fancruft', and you've given no explanation of why you think the content is non-notable. I also don't think that many people would consider making sarcastic and snide remarks to be part of improving Wikipedia, and the discussion will be much more civil if everyone abides by <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ASSUMEGOODFAITH" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ASSUMEGOODFAITH">WP:ASSUMEGOODFAITH</a>. If you think that the destination tables should be removed, you need to give clear and logical reasons supported by policy (and this doesn't include adding vague links to policy without explaining how you think the policy is relevant to the situation). Broad and unexplained criticism of the Wikiproject as a whole is only going to cause arguments, and I'm fairly sure that no one wants that to happen. <a href="/wiki/User:OakleighPark" title="User:OakleighPark">Oakleigh</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:OakleighPark" title="User talk:OakleighPark">Park</a> 10:08, 24 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Speaking of vague links to policy without explaining how you think the policy relevant, you might skip the vague link to ASSUMEGOODFAITH since no one's doubting anyone's good faith, just their editorial judgment. As to your desire for an explanation of why destination information is "non-notable", here's a vague link: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NCC" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NCC">WP:NCC</a>, which explains that notability is a test for article <i>existence</i>, not for article <i>content</i>.</dd>
<dd>Every time you defend this silliness I'm moved to make another random probe into one of these articles to see whether the incredible bloat is just my imagination. It's not. Here's more soporific overdetail:
<dl><dd><i>PIT offers on site parking operated by the Grant Oliver Corporation and patrolled by the Allegheny County Police. Grant Oliver offers usage of a GO FAST Pass account to pay for parking electronically at the airport. Go Fast Pass customers may register their E-Zpass transponders to use with the system, although billing and other aspects of the system are entirely handled by Grant Oliver. There are regular parking shuttles to the Long Term and Extended lots that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal outside doors six and eight.</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Yes, that really helps the reader understand this airport: who runs the parking, who patrols it, and how the billing works. And that doors six and eight are the way to get there. <a href="/wiki/User:EEng" title="User:EEng">EEng</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:EEng" title="User talk:EEng">talk</a>) 17:33, 24 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

</p><p>I'm getting an overall feeling like there are two different groups of people arguing over this issue. Group 1: Airport Editors. Group 2: Non-airport Editors. I, myself, am an Airport Editor who strongly agrees with having the lists of destinations for each airport. As previously stated above, us airport editors are committed to keeping each page as accurate as possible and we constantly check these destinations charts to make corrections when necessary. They are there because these charts are the most important stat of every airport page. Without them, every airport page would definitely be missing something important. I think it is vital that we keep these destination lists and keep trying to improve upon them. There is also a discussion here on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Airports" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Airports">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Airports</a> regarding former destinations charts which I also think is a great idea. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 16:39, 23 October 2015 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with AirportUpdater. If this cruft is seen as important by a small group of editors, one solution is to split off and make your own project focussing on trivia like the stairways serving former transit lounges of defunct airlines. On this project we have policies which preclude including trivia like this in our articles.

<p>The OP accidentally forgot to mention was that several editors at the ANI were that the airline and destination lists don't have references. Keeping or ditching the lists is one thing but if they are being kept then they should be sourced. The relevant piece is at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Airports/page_content#Body" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/page content">Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/page content#Body</a> item 10. However, that does not forbid the use of references. <a href="/wiki/User:MilborneOne" title="User:MilborneOne">MilborneOne</a>.

<dl><dd>"Us versus them thing" was never stated and is another false accusation. I simply said that there are two sides to the argument. One side happens to be the airport editors who are supporting keeping destinations/route charts because they are very necessary to each airport page. The other side happens to be editors that aren't that familiar with airport pages, therefore, they believe that these charts aren't that important and these pages can go without them. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 00:09, 24 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm not involved in this project, but made one or two comments in the AN/I.</dd>
<dd>Is flight information against WP policy? The scope is clearly defined and limited, the data is complete, it's not a random selection, no DIRECTORY or endless list. It doesn't match any of the descriptions under <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GUIDE" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Wikipedia:GUIDE">WP:GUIDE</a> as far as I can see.</dd>
<dd>Does it need inline citations? per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a>: "<i>any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material</i>". likely to be? No, there's nothing controversial. But if it's challenged a source must be added.</dd>
<dd>Are primary, self-published sources allowed? per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>: "<i>A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that can be verified by any educated person with access to the primary source but without further, specialized knowledge.</i>" <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a>: "<i>Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities,.</i>." (see conditions).</dd>
<dd>Just my two cents.</dd>
<dd>Maybe add a "last checked" date so people know how current the data is. I don't see any reason to remove it. For 98% of people it's the only information they are interested in, yet that's the info we would exclude? <a href="/wiki/User:Ssscienccce" title="User:Ssscienccce"><font style="color:DarkGreen;background-color:#FAFAFF;">Ssscienccce </font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ssscienccce" title="User talk:Ssscienccce">talk</a>) 01:24, 24 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>About the former destinations piece, if you read the above discussion, the current project on adding these tables is aimed for specific airports, most notably CVG, which has gone from Delta's Second Largest hub and 700 daily flights, to the smallest domestic hub for Delta, with under 100 flights a day. CVG was the #2 hub for over 35 years, so it was not like it was a brief event and was home to <a href="/wiki/Comair" title="Comair">Comair</a> which basically brought about regional flying. For these reasons, the former destination list is very meaningful on airports like CVG, and would probably really only be effective on a few other airports such as MEM, PIT, and CLE, but that is debatable to wether even they should have such a list. The destination lists, both present and former (for mainly CVG and maybe others) are very important to the page, giving an important insight and accurate view of the service offered to a particular airport. Although there are not references on every single edit and destination, many users frequently check the flights with official flight guides and quickly revert IP and other users who try to add illegitimate routes. Also, a common practice of citing routes beginning or ending in the future has been used across most airports and there is no reason to remove this info. Lastly, who cares that the articles are over-detailed, as long as it is sourced, it is still a fact, and who knows what it can be used for by someone. Why on earth would you remove info, unless it is unsourced, which then it should be removed, if the whole purpose of Wikipedia is to provide knowledge for free online.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 03:26, 24 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The airlines and routes should not be deleted because they are essential to gauge an airports connectivity, which is a very notable aspect of an airport. That said, I do agree that the current destinations need to be referenced (per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="/wiki/User:AHeneen" title="User:AHeneen">AHeneen</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHeneen" title="User talk:AHeneen">talk</a>) 17:28, 24 October 2015 (UTC)
</p><p>The current consensus is to only keep references for charter flights. We also need to keep them for scheduled flights. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233" title="Special:Contributions/87.112.66.233">87.112.66.233</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:87.112.66.233&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:87.112.66.233 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:01, 25 October 2015 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>To this respect, the ongoing discussion regarding the AfD for airline destinations should be exactly the opposite, i.e. remove destinations from airports, as they are almost totally unsourced. We can keep a record of current and terminated destinations at articles covering destinations for each airline. At this very momento, the outcome of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pages_in_Category:Lists_of_airline_destinations" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pages in Category:Lists of airline destinations">this AfD</a>  <b>keep all</b> and I don't think this will change.--<b><a href="/wiki/User:Jetstreamer" title="User:Jetstreamer">Jetstreamer</a></b>&#160;<i><sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jetstreamer#top" title="User talk:Jetstreamer">Talk</a></sup></i> 13:36, 25 October 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>But by only having information about destinations on the airline destination lists, it doesn't show the range of destinations flown to from each airport. Without a list of destinations, how would a reader easily know that, for example, <a href="/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport" class="mw-redirect" title="London Heathrow Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> serves a much greater range of destinations than <a href="/wiki/London_Southend_Airport" title="London Southend Airport">London Southend Airport</a>, or that <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Fort_Worth_Airport" class="mw-redirect" title="Dallas Fort Worth Airport">Dallas Fort Worth Airport</a> is the primary airport serving Dallas, and that <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Love_Field" title="Dallas Love Field">Dallas Love Field</a> is much smaller? (I'm sure that anyone who hasn't heard of one those airports before, and decides to click the link, will find the destination table useful for gaining an understanding of the size and significance of the airport.) The current lack of sourcing needs to be seen as a completely separate issue to the debate about whether or not the destination tables should be deleted, because the sourcing could be improved so there's no need for deletion to occur over an issue that is easily fixable. <a href="/wiki/User:OakleighPark" title="User:OakleighPark">Oakleigh</a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:OakleighPark" title="User talk:OakleighPark">Park</a> 23:37, 25 October 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Former destinations are a good idea for airports such as <a href="/wiki/Donegal_Airport" title="Donegal Airport">Donegal Airport</a>. But bigger airports...? We'd need something new. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/80.189.105.71" title="Special:Contributions/80.189.105.71">80.189.105.71</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:80.189.105.71&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:80.189.105.71 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:10, 29 October 2015 (UTC)

<p>There is a controversy by multiple, mostly IP editors, who insist AA's BOS-CUN is not seasonal because it runs more than one "season". FYI, there is no flights for the whole month of November. This is ridiculous to me!

</p>
<dl><dd>What we need to discuss is how long does a flight not operate in order to be considered a seasonal flight? Some flights do not operate for 3 or 4 months every year but they consider them seasonal. We need a consensus on how many months does not flight not operate to constitute a seasonal service. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/97.85.113.113" title="Special:Contributions/97.85.113.113">97.85.113.113</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:97.85.113.113" title="User talk:97.85.113.113">talk</a>) 06:08, 14 November 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I completely agree that BOS-CUN should be listed as seasonal. Many of AA and UA's flights (typically American Eagle and United Express) have the same predicament. If a flight is not operated (such as BOS-CUN) for a whole month (in this case, the whole month of November, for crying out loud!), then it should definitely be seen as seasonal.
<dl><dd>When implementing/deciding whether or not flights are seasonal, I think it's best to list flights as "seasonal" when the flight(s) are un-operational for a minimum of 2 ~ 4 weeks, respectively. <a href="/wiki/User:EnRouteAviation" title="User:EnRouteAviation">EnRouteAviation</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:EnRouteAviation" title="User talk:EnRouteAviation">talk</a>) 06:17, 14 November 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Continuing in this vein then, AA is suspending BOS-BUF and BOS-PIT for nearly 3 weeks from December 17, 2015 to January 4, 2016 (inclusive). Should those routes be listed as seasonal? Should there be any sort of annotation on those destinations? They're definitely being reinstated on January 5 and I assume AA intends to continue running them the other 49 weeks of the year. <a href="/wiki/User:BeIsKr" title="User:BeIsKr">BeIsKr</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:BeIsKr" title="User talk:BeIsKr">talk</a>) 16:53, 17 November 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>In this case, a simple (ends MMM DD, YYYY, resumes MMM DD, YYYY) should do it. BTW, the BOS and CUN situation seems to have stablized now, and I've found a decisive and definitive wording at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AIRPORT-CONTENT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AIRPORT-CONTENT">WP:AIRPORT-CONTENT</a> that anything not year-round is seasonal. <a href="/wiki/User:HkCaGu" title="User:HkCaGu">HkCaGu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:HkCaGu" title="User talk:HkCaGu">talk</a>) 01:36, 18 November 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Not trying to be difficult here, just clarifying in case I come across this.  I'm not sure I understand the difference between the situations.  When the above two routes "end X date, resume Y date," why is that not "anything not year round," i.e., "seasonal," by your definition? Is there is a distinguishing feature between those routes and the BOS-CUN route? Is it that the BOS-CUN flight is marketed as seasonal, but the BOS-BUF/BOS-PIT routes were temporarily stopped for some non-demand reason? Or is it that going forward, the routes will be 52 weeks a year?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:Jim0101" title="User:Jim0101">Jim0101</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jim0101" title="User talk:Jim0101">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jim0101" title="Special:Contributions/Jim0101">contribs</a>) 19:39, 29 December 2015 (UTC)</span></small></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I added the table at CVG, and I had the tabe removed many times. It seems that the consensus is that "small" airports should have the list, while larger airports should not.

<p>The fact that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Airports/page_content" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/page content">Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/page content</a> states that cargo destinations should only be listed if nonstop seems confusing—and even contradicting to me...
</p><p>It is clearly definite that on more (way many more) articles than not, these destinations for cargo airlines include one or more stops. (direct along with nonstop flights) I was aware for a long time that adding direct destinations along with non-stop has been encouraged. This is mainly due to the fact that, cargo-only OR cargo-heavy airports rely on persistent cargo-airline traffic for economy and/or air traffic boosts. Such airports include but are not limited to:

<p>My proposal here is to completely abandon (and therefore remove) the cargo destinations (table) project altogether. My reasoning for this is due to the lack of sources that are published by the airlines for these routes. As of now, it is very hard to tell if these routes are reliable without (or lack of) sources that are instated for these routes. Also, there are a lot of accounts/IP's that are adding routes that aren't verifiable. (Including myself—which I clearly see as a mistake on my part due to the lack of verifiable sources and also the gratification/significance of the issue. Because almost all of the routes are not verifiable...) Any other suggestions editors?

<dl><dd>I'm leaning toward agreement. It seems to me that while it is trivially easy to verify which cargo airlines use a given airport, it's much more difficult to verify which destinations are flow to from that airport, and that such information may be too ephemeral to be useful. Cargo airlines do certainly have scheduled routes, but they also have far more flexibility to change those routes as needed, and to add additional temporary routings as traffic warrants. Heck, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051013/news_1b13fedex.html">FedEx keeps empty planes circling the country</a> just in case they need to quickly cover an unscheduled route. In short, trying to use the same format for cargo carriers as is used for passenger carriers is a mistake, as they don't operate in the same fashion. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">oknazevad</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oknazevad" title="User talk:Oknazevad">talk</a>) 05:09, 26 December 2015 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also wouldn't object to removing cargo destinations completely. Just like the previous US regional carrier issue, maintainability is obviously suffering. IPs add but don't ever remove. But before we reach a new consensus, we already have a previous consensus (that doesn't look like editors in the know will disagree) that routes beyond the first stop are not notable. <a href="/wiki/User:HkCaGu" title="User:HkCaGu">HkCaGu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:HkCaGu" title="User talk:HkCaGu">talk</a>) 05:22, 26 December 2015 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Oppose - I dont see what the problem is the destinations section is to show the range and quantity of connections to the airport(which is why it doesnt allways need to be up to date aslong as it is referenced) and the fact that the airport operates cargo services is of note. Also we only list the first stop as we are not a travel guide and subsequent destinations are not relevant to the airport. Also we should only be limited to scheduled cargo services as ad hoc stuff is not really notable and are never listed as per passenger services. The original problem was to do with reliable references, thats easy if it cant be referenced then it can be tagged and removed. <a href="/wiki/User:MilborneOne" title="User:MilborneOne">MilborneOne</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:MilborneOne" title="User talk:MilborneOne">talk</a>) 08:59, 26 December 2015 (UTC)

<p>Not to be harsh, but the argument is stupid, really. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">Oknazevad</a> made a point about the removal of cargo destinations while the rest are bickering about sources and "unsourced" tables.

<ul><li>Nobody is bickering, taken into an account the discussion further up on destination lists both passenger and cargo it is being suggested they be replaced with a list of airlines that have or do operate from the airport which is more encyclopedic and less travel guide.

<ul><li>I think that the cargo destinations table should go and should list only the cargo carriers serving the airport as long as there is a source stating so. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/97.85.113.113" title="Special:Contributions/97.85.113.113">97.85.113.113</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:97.85.113.113" title="User talk:97.85.113.113">talk</a>) 06:34, 31 December 2015 (UTC)</li></ul>
<p>I am in disagreement with this argument, as many cargo carriers actualy post route maps on their websites. Also, FlightAware is a great resource for checking if certain routes are operated by a particular cargo airline. There are definantly sources for many routes, the problem is fewer users check and maintain these tables. Just like passengers, cargo movements are an important part of an airports operations, especially for cargo hubs like CVG, MEM, LAX, JFK, ect. These routes can be sources if that is what people want, I think most people do not know where to look. I have maintained the CVG Cargo list for quite awhile, and I always put the flight number when I add the route in my summary, maybe we could add this as hidden text in order to keep track. Lastly, it is important, just as with passengers to see the extent of operations, and the only way to do this is a table. 
Also, there is a difference between a cargo airline and a charter cargo airlines. You do NOT put the routes for charter cargo routes, as they constantly change. An exmaple is Kallita Air vs. Kalitta Charters, in this case, Kalitta Charters should not be listed.

<dl><dd>Maybe this was not clear, you find the flight, then look at the history of the number, that will show you the past flights, and if it is a charter or scheduled route. It is actually really simple and an effective way to figure out if a route is being flown by a particular airline regularly. When a cargo airlines does not offer a timetable, this works well. Also, to a point above, as has been discussed in prior sections, the purpose of destinations tables is to show the extent of service, not to be travel guide. Actually showing what airports are served by both cargo and passenger carriers give a lot more informations to a user than just x airlines serve x destinations at x airport. If the problem is sources, they exist, and can be added if that is what consesus concludes. New routes are already being sourced before they begin. It would not be that hard to source all other fligths. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 21:48, 2 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I'm in favour of getting rid of the cargo tables as well, although a list of airlines could be maintained. I was updating the Cargo table at <a href="/wiki/Kempegowda_International_Airport" title="Kempegowda International Airport">Kempegowda International Airport</a> using <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://flightmapper.net/">http://flightmapper.net/</a> , which lists scheduled cargo flights. But I didn't know whether to list cargo destinations served roundtrip, one-way, etc. For example, SQ flies BRU-BLR but not the other way around, so should it be listed? It's just confusing so I'd prefer to eliminate the tables. - <b>Sunnya343</b> 22:11, 23 January 2016 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Direct_Flights_with_stops">Direct Flights with stops</span></h2>
<p>My question here is specifically regarding direct flights that are not spoke-hub-spoke with passenger pick-up rights on all legs. I'm talking about international flights such as JFK-FRA-SIN on Singapore Airlines or JFK-YVR-MNL on Philippine Airlines. I recently removed some of these 3rd non-nonstop destinations on the JFK article because, to me, it didn't seem logical to list SIN or MNL as 'destinations' from JFK when they literally do not have a single flight to those destinations. (Note: I do get the JFK-LAX-SYD issue, where there is no right for Qantas to fly simply from JFK to LAX, but this is different, b/c there are 5th freedom rights from JFK-FRA and JFK-YVR.)
</p><p>I noticed that two of my edits, JFK-LFW-ADD on Ethiopian and JFK-MDE-CLO on Avianca, were promptly reverted. Feel free to revert others if I was off base my edits. I know that the WP:AIRPORT content guide says only list direct flights that are not spoke-hub-spoke, but why list the 3rd destination when it's spoke-focus-focus or even hub-hub-hub? It just doesn't seem accurate to me to say that Avianca 'flies' to that 2nd focus city. Moreover, drawing a bright line at non-stop destinations (with the exception of the JFK-LAX-SYD situation) would make this whole thing much simpler, while eliminating subjective judgment calls as to what's really a "real" destination of a multi-stop direct flight.

<dl><dd>Please note WP:AIRPORT-CONTENT guide point #7, direct flights are included as long as the same plane and flight number is used all the way through to the final destination (please note that SQ and PR uses the same aircraft and flight number on these routes and Frankfurt/Vancouver are not hubs for the SQ/PR) and that they do not contain a stop at an airline hub. But as for QF JFK-LAX-SYD, QF does not have eighth freedom rights to transport passengers solely from JFK to LAX (therefore, LAX is not listed at the JFK article but it has a footnote explaining the stop and regarding the rights. However, PAL also operates a YYZ-YVR-MNL route but I am not sure if the aircraft used on that route is the same as the JFK-YVR-MNL route. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/97.85.118.142" title="Special:Contributions/97.85.118.142">97.85.118.142</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:97.85.118.142" title="User talk:97.85.118.142">talk</a>) 16:58, 1 February 2016 (UTC)</dd>

The only agreement I see with these changes is that whenever this topic comes up, either no one responds or consesus cannot be achieved.

With this logic, CVG should be changed to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky because of Lunken, PIT to Pittsburg–International because of Latrobe, and CLE to Cleveland–Hopkins because of Burke. All these smaller airports have scheduled passenger commercial service, but I do not necessarily think they should be changed. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 00:52, 13 April 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Yes, Orlando and Phoenix have been discussed in the past but there have been no solutions. Therefore, you CANNOT make mass edits like you did without consensus. Regarding Columbus, this airport absolutely does not need disambiguation as it is the main airport for the city. The city isn't even a major city that has multiple major airports. Midwestern cities such as St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, etc. do not need disambiguation with their major airports. Every city is going to have county airports and other various airports scattered throughout the region and those airports really only have the closest "major" city in their name so people know where that smaller town is located near. If every major airport was listed with another name, things would get very confusing. I still agree that Orlando and Phoenix should just be listed as it should be and Columbus shouldn't even be discussed for any changes. Besides, OH must be included in the name because there are multiple cities that are named Columbus in the US. I have deleted all of the (Columbus-Port Columbus) edits because I think they are the most silly, I will wait on Orlando and Phoenix to be discussed about. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 03:08, 13 April 2016 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Charter_Flight_Listings">Charter Flight Listings</span></h2>
<p>This definitely is one of the most discussed questions within the Airport Editing community and probably has already been discussed in another thread (maybe it was archived too soon?), but how should charter flights be listed? Should they be listed separately or should they be listed along with the regularly scheduled flights? I have browsed around through many airport pages and have noticed that some have separate "Charters" sections and some don't. Thoughts? <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 22:30, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>My 2 cents is that they should be listed along with the other passenger destinations, but with the bolded "Charter:" designation. I say this because they are often just operating out of the same terminals, often operated by many of the same airlines, and in effect are the same 'thing' as a regularly scheduled commercial operation, if we want to get all philosophical about it. Listing only 'public charters' as defined by the FAA is an easy bright line to resolve <i>which</i> charters should go on the list, if that's up for debate. The FAA publishes a regularly updated list of approved public charter prospectuses at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/licensing/public-charters">https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/licensing/public-charters</a>.</dd></dl>

<dd>The AIP for Kyrgyzstan is available at EAD (but one needs to create a login). It shows only four aerodromes, not including this Tamga place, but all four have ICAO codes like UCxx. So I think it is safe to assume UCFA must be correct. The confusion must come from the effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Focus_cities">Focus cities</span></h2>
<p>What clearly defines a "focus city"? Some airlines specifically state that an airport is a focus city while others do not. For example Southwest does not. So how was the list of focus cities for Southwest compiled in its article's infobox? Top 10 airports? That seems arbitrary. - <b><a href="/wiki/User:Sunnya343" title="User:Sunnya343">&#9992;Sunnya343&#9992;</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sunnya343" title="User talk:Sunnya343">talk</a>) 23:42, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The currently accepted means for calling a focus city it that it must be listed on the website of the airline in some fashion. For instance, JetBlue lists Boston as a Focus City on its website, so it is listed as this instead of a hub (although by official definitions is a hub). Similar to "Low-Cost" Airlines (If You Can Call Southwest One at this Point), as recently discused with Frontier, Dever is listed as a hub, then a number of cities are inicated as focus cities based on their route map, whihc uses larger dots for its focus cities. As for Southwest, searching their website, the words "focus city" nor "hub" are listed anywehre on the website. Technically, then nothing should be listed, but per discussion about Allegiant Air, it was decided that maintinence bases would be listed as "maintinece bases" on the airlines page, while the airport pages would still retain the "focus city" lable. See <a href="/wiki/Allegiant_Air" title="Allegiant Air">Allegiant Air</a> for an example.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Based on Southwest's Website, here are its Maintinence  Bases:</dd>
<dd>Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa Bay</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The thing, just like many other "Low Cost" carriers is that they try to minimze connections and maximize nonstop flights. I think listing all these cities as focus cities is too much, because Southwest's model is to provide even service to all the countries major markets. I think the best solution to this problem is to only list these maintinence bases. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 23:36, 19 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>It would be so much easier if Southwest would list their focus cities, but sadly they do not. Stinger20 does make a lot of good points. I don't think Southwest is any different than Frontier for example. They are not "hub and spoke" airlines, but are "point to point" airlines. SW does have a lot of airports where they connect passengers through such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and so on. However, many of them have lots of flights simply because a lot of people go to a particular destination. So, as Stinger20 says, I think the 11 maintenance bases listed above should be on Southwest's page and list the airport pages as focus cities, same as Frontier. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 00:39, 20 May 2016 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Continuing my point, keep the current pages that are listed as focus cities the same.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>A typical definition states that a "Focus City" is an airport where an airline has flights to destinations that are not the hub of the airline (if the hub is "A", the airline flies from the Focus City "B" to "C", "D"...). thie doesn't mean that this airport is a Base, because a Focus City can also have all flights operated with aircraft operated by other bases without night-stop. <a href="/wiki/User:Wjkxy" title="User:Wjkxy">Wjkxy</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wjkxy" title="User talk:Wjkxy">talk</a>) 11:53, 24 May 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manston_Airport">Manston Airport</span></h2>
<p>Good morning. As some may know <a href="/wiki/Manston_Airport" title="Manston Airport">Manston Airport</a> is a former airport in the UK. There is a proposal on the table for it to be turned into a housing development, which is fair enough. However some editors wish to change the name of the article to represent this post-airport naming and use. I have an issue with this. I believe the article subject should remain the airport and that the post-airport use should be a separate article as the article is about the subject not the land. Additionally even the official website for the post-airport use lists it as a proposal, there's nothing more than an idea here at the moment and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Those are however my views and interpretations and others may have different ones. If people could take the time to chime in on the talk page one way or another for a discussion then it would be appreciated.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Orlando_International">Orlando International</span></h2>
<p>I know this topic has been discussed many times beforehand and really, nothing was done to resolve the problem. Recently, one user decided to switch "Orlando" to "Orlando-International" on every airport without discussing here, and their edits were not changed since then. I have a proposal. I have viewed many airport online sites and have seen how they list <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> on their departures/arrivals lists and the most common way of listing this airport is as the following: Orlando-MCO or Orlando/MCO. I'm starting to think this is the correct way of listing this airport now once and for all. Anyone agree? Please leave your thoughts and opinions. Thanks. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 18:56, 13 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I am quite firmly <i>against</i> this proposal <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">*AirportUpdater*</a>:</span>. Airports list Orlando-MCO because they need a shorthand way for the airport. On Wikipedia, we aren't confined to space as such. London's airports are abbreviated as London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick etc. Orlando International is the name of the airport, as is Orlando Sanford, so why should it not stay as Orlando-International and Orlando-Sanford? <b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 23:04, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ok, first of all, MCO was always listed as "Orlando" since the start of Wikipedia. Then this past March, "Orlando" was switched to "Orlando-International" <b>without</b> consensus. This particular user (which you can see the discussion in this talk page) got a lot of heat for doing this. So, that's the history of MCO. Since then, no one has done anything to change these mass edits, probably due to the large amounts of edits to switch. Now, if you are so strongly against my edits because Orlando "International" is the name, then what about every other airport named "International"? So now we must change Pittsburgh to Pittsburgh-International, Indianapolis to Indianapolis-International, Kansas City to Kansas City-International? No, it doesn't make sense. It is much better to distinguish two airports in the same city by a specific name, not a word such as "International" that every airport has in its name. That's why every airport site lists MCO as "Orlando-MCO" and that's why I changed Wikipedia destination lists to "Orlando-MCO". Because it's the most accurate way to disambiguate MCO and SFB. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 23:29, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>If we're going to disambiguate (and I agree we should), then full words, not IATA codes are a better method. More importantly, this is something that should have been proposed first, not done as though it were <i>fair accompli</i>. More importantly, I would say there was consensus to use "Orlando-International". That's certainly the way I read the prior discussion. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">oknazevad</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oknazevad" title="User talk:Oknazevad">talk</a>) 23:39, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>If you think full words are necessary, then why is New York-JFK listed the way its listed? Also, how come all of a sudden everyone's responding FINALLY to my comment? Because I ignited the spark by making all the edits. If I didn't do this, my comment would've never been responded to or discussed about. Last thing, again, there was NEVER a consensus regarding this issue. It was always discussed in the past and then put away. So, I'd say if we are never going to form a consensus, we should just go with what the airports are doing (which we should be doing anyway). <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 00:26, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>JFK has always been the exception, as it's not only widely used locally, but it's well known all over the world. And I would say that the discussion from last year had a consensus, with only one user filibustering because he didn't agree with the consensus because it was a change from past practice.

<dl><dd>By tagging some editors it would've been helpful as not everyone watches this talk page. With regards to your earlier comment about international, I'm saying that we should keep the status quo by disambiguating Orlando-International using international. You can't compare Orlando to JFK as JFK is known world wide. Also, I want to note here how Belfast has two airports and one airport is distinguished from the other by being called Belfast-International (as per Belfast International Airport). The same case applies here. I think we should revert back to International. <b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 00:59, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I mentioned JFK due to the comment about full words. If you want Orlando to be accompanied by a full word (International), then why not word out JFK (John F. Kennedy)? Paris-CDG words out Charles-de Guelle for example. That's why I mentioned JFK. Anyway, I'm a strong believer in shortening things and not making things too complicated. It seems everyone here wants to word out everything and clobber up the destination lists with additional words that don't have to be there. Another example is Phoenix-Sky Harbor. Why is this worded out? I think if we can shorten things down while not changing the general scope of the destination, it's perfectly fine. "Orlando-MCO" perfectly describes <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> and also is a great way to disambiguate the two airports from each other. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 01:12, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Paris-CDG is an international airport that is named after a famous person so I think it is totally appropriate here instead of giving it its full title of Charles de Gaulle. To be quite frank, Wikipedia is not supposed to confuse things with a bunch of abbreviations. We're supposed to use its most well known title. I can't comment on Sky Harbour because I don't know anything about the airport but how else could it be shortened? Keep Wikipedia easy to read, easy to understand and it is therefore less confusing to use International rather than MCO. <b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 01:26, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, looks like CDG is yet another airport that could be discussed forever. This airport is even worse because the amount of destinations that'd need changed is staggering. Right now, they are all listed as "Paris-Charles de Gaulle". Regarding Sky Harbor, I think it should be left alone how it was before the change a month ago (just as "Phoenix"). Regarding MCO, I still can't see International as correct. I've never seen it. Between the 3 ways its been listed (Orlando, Orlando-International, Orlando-MCO), I think Orlando-International is the worst. SFB (Orlando/Sanford) has International in its name as well, using this word is just a bad way of distinguishing two airports. I can't believe no one else can see it. <a href="/wiki/User:*AirportUpdater*" title="User:*AirportUpdater*">&#42;AirportUpdater*</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:*AirportUpdater*" title="User talk:*AirportUpdater*">talk</a>) 01:37, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Please bear in mind that a lot of users on Wikipedia are not aware of IATA codes. I am firmly opposed to MCO because abbreviations are not user-friendly. I would like to revert to Orlando-International <i>for the time being</i> and I would be happy to do this. Orlando is not a well known airport in my eyes (compared with the likes of JFK) and using abbreviations here would be totally inappropriate. You have brought up a good point about SFB using the word 'International' in its name, but it is also true that MCO is the primary airport. We need to name the airports in a way that they are easily recognised by the user, and in this case, International seems to be the preferable option at the moment. <b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 02:05, 20 May 2016 (UTC) <br />I also just wanted to add that I've checked a few airport pages and they list Orlando-International as just 'Orlando'. <a href="/wiki/Gatwick_Airport" title="Gatwick Airport">Gatwick Airport</a> lists Orlando and Orlando (Sanford) appropriately.

<dd>If not JFK, then "New York-Kennedy" would be appropriate for space purposes. The main point there is that "MCO" is not a well known abbreviation to the general readership, unlike JFK, which is widely used in everyday speech. Likewise, outside of air buffs, Charles de Gaulle is rarely refered to as CDG. "Paris-de Gaulle" would be appropriate as a shorter form, but not the IATA code, as is obscure. But still, all this is false equivalency that distracts from the issue that there was consensus for "Orlando-International" to disambiguate from "Orlando-Sanford", and you disagreed and forced an unneeded change against consensus. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">oknazevad</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oknazevad" title="User talk:Oknazevad">talk</a>) 02:25, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, if you think MCO would confuse the "general readership", then how is International better? Both <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> and <a href="/wiki/Orlando_Sanford_International_Airport" title="Orlando Sanford International Airport">Orlando Sanford International Airport</a> have that word in their names. So, now I go back to my original thought back in 2015...should it just be "Orlando" if you are worried about how the "general readership" will view these airports.
<dl><dd>"Paris-de Gaulle", what such an horrific name in a French ear... We french commonly shortens the name of CDG as "Paris-CDG" (less often 'Roissy' and everyone comprehends it.

We want a name that is readily recognisable and able to distinguish itself easily.

<ul><li><i>Orlando</i> and <i>Orlando/Sanford</i> - Someone who is flying Allegiant or Thomson into Sanford might see <i>Orlando</i> on multiple articles and figure that is the same airport they're flying to.

<li><i>Orlando–International</i> and <i>Orlando–Sanford</i> - As AirportUpdater stated, both airports have <i>International</i> in their names.</li>
<li><i>Orlando–MCO</i> and <i>Orlando/Sanford</i>(?) - I think this is the best option. If someone is confused by <i>MCO</i> then they can just click on the airport link.</li></ul>

<p>The current situation here while strange is not particularly hard for people to comprehend, one of these airports is clearly more prominent than the other and the current situation reflects this situation perfectly.  Anything you do like the absolutely horrible MCO suggestion will only confuse people and make matters worse.  Please remember Wikipedia is an encyclopedia it is not a guide book or a travel guide, and we cannot just make up a name because it is inconvenient.  <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 07:02, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a>:</span> All in all, I evidently have to agree with you here Andrew. For someone that were to see the suffix of "MCO" added to Orlando would most likely be confused because it is not common knowledge to associate "MCO" with Orlando, though this is the ICAO code for the airport. I'm pretty sure the only common knowledge labeling of an ICAO code is New York–JFK, which is currently working very well. With that said though, adding the "International" suffix to the airport would also be confusing because both MCO and SFB (Orlando/Sanford) fly international routes; its just that the title of the MCO article is labeled as Orlando "International" Airport.</dd>
<dd>I know that we've started this discussion up several times already at WT:AIRPORTS, but <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> does bring up a good point that the current labeling will definitely confuse people more than helping them to distinguish the two airports, which is the underlying goal here in the first place.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>PROPOSAL:</b>
<dl><dd>I really think that we need to go back to labeling MCO as "Orlando" as it originally was. Now I do believe that we came to a consensus a long while back to keep this as such, but <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Airports/Archive_15#User:SSTflyer">this discussion</a> came about when a particular user was repeatedly changing the labeling of lots of different airports, such as "Phoenix" to "Phoenix–Sky Harbor", among others including the Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit and Pittsburgh airports as well. Overall, the "International" suffix should not be used because of the fact that it is very redundant since an airport that would supposedly be labeled as "International" would be the larger airport of the two (or more) airports anyways... This also applies to the Kuala Lumpur and the Dubai airports as well. Eliminating the "International" suffix on all of the labels that currently contain it in my mind seems like the best solution to take care of a lot of labeling issues because the airports are already "International Airports", making it not only confusing but also being redundant as well.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Regarding the labels that don't use the "International" suffix, such as Phoenix–Sky Harbor, Phoenix/Mesa, Orlando/Sanford, and Dubai–Al Maktoum, among others, the labels should probably not contain an additional suffix unless the airports are clearly distinctive in the amount of operations occurring between the two (or more) airports. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2601:1C0:4401:F360:3E77:E6FF:FE9F:4AF3" title="Special:Contributions/2601:1C0:4401:F360:3E77:E6FF:FE9F:4AF3">2601:1C0:4401:F360:3E77:E6FF:FE9F:4AF3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:2601:1C0:4401:F360:3E77:E6FF:FE9F:4AF3" title="User talk:2601:1C0:4401:F360:3E77:E6FF:FE9F:4AF3">talk</a>) 03:51, 22 June 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Restarting this discussion again because the last one clearly went nowhere, and the last IP to comment on the previous thread is apparently now blocked. Anyway, in light of the edit warring that has occurred at <a href="/wiki/John_Glenn_Columbus_International_Airport" title="John Glenn Columbus International Airport">John Glenn Columbus International Airport</a> back in June and more recently at <a href="/wiki/Calgary_International_Airport" title="Calgary International Airport">Calgary International Airport</a>. Here's my take on the issue: 
</p><p>The current labeling of <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> as "Orlando–MCO" causes a lot of problems because the ICAO code "MCO" is not commonly associated with the airport itself. In comparison to this, the labeling of <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport" title="John F. Kennedy International Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> as "New York–JFK" makes much more sense because the JFK suffix in the labeling is abbreviated from <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. Because of this, it is common knowledge to associate "JFK Airport" in relation John F. Kennedy, and thus, it makes sense to label the airport as such.
</p><p>On the other hand, "MCO" is <i><b>not</b></i> of any sort of common knowledge to most people, because the title of the airport is merely, "<a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a>". Nowhere in that airport's title, does the abbreviation of "MCO" come into play, as New York's JFK airport, the abbreviation of "JFK" refers to the title of that airport in itself.
</p><p>With this all in mind, we need to look at other cities with multiple high-usage airports. For example, Dubai's Al Maktoum airport is currently labeled as "Dubai–Al Maktoum". This works greatly because the suffix "Al Maktoum" is within the title of the airport, similarly to JFK, which is abbreviated after John F. Kennedy. If Al Maktoum International Airport were to be labeled with the ICAO code as "Dubai–DWC", this would cause a similar issue as the Orlando–MCO issue. 
</p><p>Now, Dubai's other airport is labeled as "Dubai–International" in order to help disambiguate Dubai's two airports. I see this situation with "Orlando–MCO" to be extremely similar to Dubai's airports. With the following in mind, here is my proposal:

<dl><dd><b>Strong support:</b> I fully support this proposal. I believe that it's more fitting for International to be used rather than MCO, which is complete nonsense. Sanford is referred to as Sanford and, as Orlando is the primary airport, I see no problem calling it Orlando-International. --<b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 03:22, 1 August 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Strong Support:</b> I do not support the "MCO" title at all. I think Orlando should just use <b>Orlando</b> preferably or if not <b>Orlando–International</b> for <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando International Airport</a> and <b>Sanford/Orlando</b> for <a href="/wiki/Orlando_Sanford_International_Airport" title="Orlando Sanford International Airport">Orlando Sanford International Airport</a>. My thought is, look at other Allegiant cities in Florida. In Tampa we use Tampa for <a href="/wiki/Tampa_International_Airport" title="Tampa International Airport">Tampa International Airport</a> and St. Petersburg/Clearwater for <a href="/wiki/St._Pete%E2%80%93Clearwater_International_Airport" title="St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport">St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport</a>. Simarly in Fort Meyers we use Fort Meyers for <a href="/wiki/Southwest_Florida_International_Airport" title="Southwest Florida International Airport">Southwest Florida International Airport</a> and Punta Gorda/Fort Meyers for <a href="/wiki/Punta_Gorda_Airport" class="mw-disambig" title="Punta Gorda Airport">Punta Gorda Airport</a>. I do not think the international part is necessary, but it is certainly much better than MCO. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 04:53, 1 August 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>Support/Comment:</b> I think Stinger20 brings up the most logical solution to all this. It fits the most with how other city's airports are currently labeled. One other example is with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh International Airport is labeled as "Pittsburgh" and Arnold Palmer Airport (Latrobe) which is 65 miles away is labeled as "Latrobe/Pittsburgh". Orlando should probably follow this same path. "Orlando" for MCO and "Sanford/Orlando" for SFB. I believe Dubai International was also brought up above. This should also be looked into about changing to this type of format.

<dd><b>Strong Support:</b> I do not support the labelling in its current state. It is confusing and cannot be compared to JFK or even CDG, where the physical airport names happen to relate to the ICAO codes. After searching various airlines websites, those who fly into Sanford list the destination as Orlando/Sanford or a similiar wording. Orlando is listed as "Orlando" on the vast majority of the carriers websites (Air Canada, Delta, Spirit, United, WestJet to name a few), however is listed as Orlando-International on American's website. Based upon that, I see no reason why <b>Orlando-International</b> (or even just "Orlando") is not a suitable, and support the decision to go with that labelling. <a href="/wiki/User:Garretka" title="User:Garretka">Garretka</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Garretka" title="User talk:Garretka">talk</a>) 12:55, 1 August 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Support:</b> There is no real easy solution here as one of these airports has consciously named itself confusingly. My view as I have said before is that simply "Orlando" for the big airport that gets 99% of the traffic and is the airport for Orlando in 99% of peoples minds is just fine - the simple solution is always likely to be the best.  The upstart (perhaps inappropriately named) airport needs a qualifier and that qualifier must include Sanford.  The word international is a little problematic but I would not be worried if consensus included it. Additionally we should perhaps be guided by <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>  which is one of the biggest reasons the MCO solution is so horrible and perhaps <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NATURALDIS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NATURALDIS">WP:NATURALDIS</a> I know these are mainly about article titles but it would be sensible that entries linking to pages should reflect as best possible actual article titles.  Also important is to not take the maintenance and scope of destination lists too far, it is important to remember that Wikipedia is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL">WP:NOTTRAVEL</a>, but perhaps that is another discussion. <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 01:59, 2 August 2016 (UTC)

<ul><li><b>Support</b> "Orlando-International" and "Orlando-Sanford". I ca may pathos with wanting to avoid confusion because both are international airports and have the term in their full names, but the current solution is lousy (as the "MCO" airport code is not well known like "JFK", which is used in everyday speech around the world) and just "Orlando" is actually less informative, as both are airports serving Orlando, so the plain city name doesn't actually tell the reader which airport it is. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">oknazevad</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oknazevad" title="User talk:Oknazevad">talk</a>) 03:17, 4 August 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I think so, I have changed some smaller airports (GRR, ROC, TVC, MSN), but I am waiting for more acceptance on larger airports. The only large airport I have changed is CVG.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposed_change_to_disambiguation_rule">Proposed change to disambiguation rule</span></h3>
<p>In previous discussions on Orlando I had brought up parallel issues like Phoenix, Seattle/Vancouver (and their water airports), and someone brought up Montreal and Cincinnati, and then there was Panama City. Things are so complicated, we didn't get anywhere. Yet the edit war slowly continued. After all these and the recent discussion, may I propose relaxing the disambiguation rule (multiple airports in same city, must disambiguate) in favor of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a>. I don't know how to rephrase <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AIRPORT-CONTENT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AIRPORT-CONTENT">WP:AIRPORT-CONTENT</a> yet, but it goes something like this:
</p>
<ul><li>If a city has multiple airports, but one is overwhelmingly dominant, and much larger than any other competitors, and is known simply by the city's name without much confusion, let it take over the simple city name. This would include Beijing, Phoenix, Orlando, Vancouver, Panama City, Montreal, Cincinnati, Kuala Lumpur.</li>
<li>The much smaller airports that have obscured location or city name will have the disambiguation. This would include Beijing-Nanyuan, Phoenix-Mesa, Orlando-Sanford, Vancouver-Harbour, Panama City-Albrook, Montreal-Saint-Hubert, Cincinnati-Lunken, Kuala Lumpur-Subang.</li>
<li>All other cities with smaller airports of significant sizes will continue to disambiguate all airports. This would include London, Tokyo, Jakarta, Seoul, Bangkok, Shanghai, NYC, Chicago, Houston, Paris, Berlin, Toronto.</li></ul>
<p>Basically, we shake off the disambiguation for the big airport where everyone serving there does not "disambiguate" in their operations. <a href="/wiki/User:HkCaGu" title="User:HkCaGu">HkCaGu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:HkCaGu" title="User talk:HkCaGu">talk</a>) 06:20, 3 August 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>It is also an acceptable solution, but I foresee conflicts also with it. What happens with cities having airports with comparable traffic (i.e, <a href="/wiki/Paris-Orly" class="mw-redirect" title="Paris-Orly">Paris-Orly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paris-CDG" class="mw-redirect" title="Paris-CDG">Paris-CDG</a> or <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires-Ezeiza" class="mw-redirect" title="Buenos Aires-Ezeiza">Buenos Aires-Ezeiza</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires-Aeroparque" class="mw-redirect" title="Buenos Aires-Aeroparque">Buenos Aires-Aeroparque</a>)?

<dd><b>Support</b>. As mentioned above, airports with comparable traffic should continue to be differentiated. But a line needs to be drawn as to where we need and don't need disambiguation. <a href="/wiki/User:Garretka" title="User:Garretka">Garretka</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Garretka" title="User talk:Garretka">talk</a>) 16:08, 3 August 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>General Support</b>.  I'm not sure this needs to go past some guidance about disambiguation principles.  Mine would be 1. Only disambiguate where necessary 2.use the principles of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">WP:COMMONNAME</a> as guidance, and in this case - 3. it is alright to disambiguate by having a general term for a big thing and qualified general term for a lesser thing.  This is most likely the simplest most understandable solution to the most people.  Torturous constructions trying to minutely explain differences will nearly always fail to do so clearly.<a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 21:12, 17 August 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I beg to differ. <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a>, you are unilaterally going against consensus.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>With respect - you can disagree all you want - but removing valid references from Wikipedia articles is wrong.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Can I suggest that maybe you broaden your editing on Wikipedia to include other topics as then you will.understand how referencing works and the need for it - editing in tall narrow silos is problematic as this thread shows.

<p>Can we get some more clarity on the issue because there have been some issues regarding this topic on various airport articles. Do we source current destinations or not and if there are certain exceptions, laid out clearly, what exactly are these exceptions. Also, if a route is ending (or beginning for that matter) and there is no source besides the airline's schedule, do we put a "citation need" alert next to it or is the airline schedule enough of a source? Obviously if there is a source, that's best but sometimes there simply is no other source.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>The quick answer is yes the timetable is a valid reference for the existence of a flight so long as you provide it as a reference - however it is always better to use a secondary source as per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SECONDARY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SECONDARY">WP:SECONDARY</a> - and just to be absolutely clear the airline timetable is a PRIMARY (ie not preferred) source for this information. For start and finish dates the working out of all this is getting pretty close to original research - you are researching the subject yourself and coming up with a derived answer to the question rather than repeating what someone else has published.  This is why such references are nearly always from the media or airline publications and not from the timetable.  This at first I know seems counterintuitive but it is like that because secondary sources better ensure notability and guard against original research.  Much of the contention in the above discussion rests around the questionable fit the current format and depth of the destination tables with these policies.  <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 05:53, 4 November 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I am wondering if someone would be willing to team up with me and help edit the boxes and technical information for these articles while I handle the history aspects? I'm a total newbie to how the maps work in the boxes and also do not want to put incorrect info in the boxes, and I simply don't understand how to parse "raw" data on runways I am seeing to separate it and put it in the boxes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Template:IATA_code_for_US_with_FAA_..._is_erroneous">Template:IATA code for US with FAA ... is erroneous</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Template:IATA_code_for_US_with_FAA" title="Template:IATA code for US with FAA">Template:IATA code for US with FAA</a>: This template appears to be an old one, and has gone unquestioned for some time.  The logic behind the template is based on the fact that the IATA tries to use 3-letter codes for major airports which coincide with the codes issued by the local governing authority, in this case the FAA.  However, the fact that most IATA codes for airports in the United States are the same as their FAA or ICAO code is unfortunately taken to equate to "most airports in the US having the same code..." under both systems.  This actually is not the case.  The fact is that the IATA doesn't recognize the majority of airports in the US, because they don't need to.  Many airports in the United states use a combination of letters and numbers, 3 or 4 digits in length (the 4-digit codes represent private-use airports), and the IATA doesn't issue those types of codes at all.  So, while the IATA code will most often be the same as the FAA code, the reverse is not actually true.  MOST airports in the United states do not have the same FAA and IATA code.  Most US airports have no need for an IATA code, and therefore don't have one. Since the IATA uses a 3-letter code identifier, this would very sharply limit the ability for that organization to account for all the world's airports, were that the case.  In fact, it would only allow for something like 17,000 different 3-letter combinations, while there are approximately 44,000 airports in the world, and there are over 19,000 airports in the US alone.  The US, by itself, would use up all of the possible combinations of letters were the IATA to attempt to include them all in its nomenclature.  In fact, they limit such identification to those airports which have commercial service (passenger or cargo) or have in the not-too-distant past.  This is quite decidedly a minority of US airports.  Therefore, I feel this template should be eliminated and or corrected.  It is incorrect, and often unnecessary.  <a href="/wiki/User:Bengleman" title="User:Bengleman">Mister Sparkle</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bengleman" title="User talk:Bengleman">talk</a>) 02:49, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>You are right, it is erroneous. However, since the IATA/FAA difference is a significant source of errors in quite a few data sources (for instance, Geonames), I would vote to fix the erroneous part of the template, rather than eliminate it. By the way, IATA codes also reference railway and bus stations, heliports, sea plane bases, ferry ports. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Denis.arnaud" title="User:Denis.arnaud">Denis.arnaud</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Denis.arnaud" title="User talk:Denis.arnaud">talk</a>) 17:49, 15 November 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I am interested in this topic since that I've developed a template in french {{Aéroport|code=xxx}} as this template helps finding the right french wiki article of airport. And it does indeed not take into account the FAA US minor airports pb.

<dd>I'm not against Denis's idea to fix the erroneous aspect of the template, as opposed to eliminating it. And then, making sure that the template is only used when an airport actually has an IATA code...in some cases, this template is used when there is no IATA code, which I think is pointless.  Something like "While the IATA usually tries to use the same 3-letter identifier for US airports as that used by the FAA.."

<h2><span id="Definition_of_.22airport_in_a_city.22"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_of_&quot;airport_in_a_city&quot;">Definition of "airport in a city"</span></h2>
<p>In lists like <a href="/wiki/List_of_cities_with_more_than_one_airport" class="mw-redirect" title="List of cities with more than one airport">List of cities with more than one airport</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_busiest_city_airport_systems_by_passenger_traffic" title="List of busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic">List of busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic ‎</a>, one of the most commonly argued point is about what count as an airport serving the city and what does not count. For instance on one of those article I have cited a source that the airport in Tijuana can be count as serving Mexico but another editor disagree. Any input? And then there are also some discussion about should GA airports count, and should scheduled charter services count. Or should we simply delete those articles on the ground of too much OR in the article definition? <a href="/wiki/User:C933103" title="User:C933103">C933103</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:C933103" title="User talk:C933103">talk</a>) 05:42, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

<ul><li><b>Reply</b>: Your remark points the oddity of some airports, like Châlons Vatry Airport, supposed to be serving Paris, whilst it's 147km far away and thus is not seriously serving Paris.--<a href="/wiki/User:Bouzinac" title="User:Bouzinac">Bouzinac</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bouzinac" title="User talk:Bouzinac">talk</a>) 20:37, 21 November 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I believe it's up to the city to decide if a particular airport officially serves them or another city. Think London, it recognizes 6 airports as serving it thought there are other airports nearby that they don't recognize. I have heard that there is a particular reason why big cities like London and Paris do this, thought I don't remember why? Now to answer some of your questions; if I were you I would open up a discussion with the user that disagrees with you about Tijuana and try to come to a consensus about the issue. But remember that Wikipedia doesn't have to have the most up-to-date information regardless if you can cite it or not; most of these list articles are only updated once a year. So don't feel bad if you get nowhere with that user. I definitely believe that "Should the GA and charter flights count" is a wonderful topic for a discussion. <i>Have a nice day</i>, <a href="/wiki/User:KDTW_Flyer" title="User:KDTW Flyer"><span style="color:red;">KDTW</span> <span style="color:SteelBlue;"><i>Flyer</i></span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KDTW_Flyer#top" title="User talk:KDTW Flyer">talk</a>) 21:28, 21 November 2016 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. None of this would be an issue if we were to simply have a general reference to the airline's schedule next to the airlines name or in a "notes" column. We don't need a reference for each individual destination (except for the ones beginning of ending, as we already do), just a general one for each airline. <a href="/wiki/User:Oknazevad" title="User:Oknazevad">oknazevad</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Oknazevad" title="User talk:Oknazevad">talk</a>) 23:44, 13 November 2016 (UTC)

<ul><li>Many airlines don't have PDF published on website and online timetable data is not always accurate.  There is no need for such referencing I feel.  I edit Irish airports mostly and always review schedules at beginning of each season to see if there is any changes and reference as required.

<li><b>Support</b> It is usually easily to check if a scheduled flight is still running by looking at the airline's timetable or booking engine. I would make an exemption though for charter flights as these can be very difficult to verify and often if the charter stops running they don't get removed, particularly at busy airports where it can be hard to keep track. The same should apply to cargo flights. <a href="/wiki/User:VG31" title="User:VG31"><span style="font-family:&#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;,serif;color:green"><b>VG31</b></span></a> 02:01, 14 November 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> The current system is perfectly fine. I think that haveing a citation for everything listed would be too complicated and make the article extremely long in terms of total bytes, which someone actually has to pay for. The other thing is where would you find sources to claim a route is legit, it would just be too hard to enforce. With the PDF schedules, it would be too hard to cite it for each airline like mentioned above because... <b>A.</b> users will just get lazy and not put the page numbers in the citation, which means when someone wants to look at it, they will have to spend valuable time looking for the page with the routes for that particular airport (the Delta PDF flight schedule for this month is 1603 pages long). <b>B.</b> As already stated not all airlines publish their timetables. - If one were to question a routes legitness, all one has to do is look at Flightaware or other similar web services and they can tell you if a route is real or not. As for beginning/ending routes, I expect to see a citation to support the claim. That isn't hard because people hear about these things in the newspapers and press releases, both of which are available online.

<ul><li><b>Weak support</b> Oknazevad makes a good point. However, airport destinations change so quickly that it would be unfeasible to require references for them.

<li><b>Comment</b> I support removal of table only the airlines serving an airport should remain with ref ofcourse, I have never found the destinations section of airports serving any purpose, only the airline information is of interest. some people argue wiki is not a travel guide well by listing all these destinations it certainly seems like it is, its totally unecessary and pedantic. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/139.190.175.128" title="Special:Contributions/139.190.175.128">139.190.175.128</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:139.190.175.128" title="User talk:139.190.175.128">talk</a>) 05:35, 21 November 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> We should somehow modify #10 to help end this edit war. A new daily or weekly nonstop route is usually not going to be challenged, so the reference can be removed once it starts. However, anything unusual, like multi-stops, charters, seasonals, or obscured airlines, should probably have the references kept.

<p><b>Note</b> If you are going to add sources or revert someone who removed them, make sure they actually are a source stating the route is running. I have seen multiple examples of users adding references that do not prove wether the route is currently running. For instance, an article announcing that Delta will launch CVG-SAN flights on June 16, 2017 can remain until that date. On that date, it is perfectly acceptable to remove the source as it does not give any explanation that the route is running, as it does not tell you if/when the route actually began. If you insist in putting a reference, it NEEDS to show that the route is running. Examples include press release on launch day, timetables, route maps, ect. Quoting some users above, many of these sources are not "VALID" indications that the route is running and are completely useless. Sources that show the route is running should be allowed per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Verify" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Verify">WP:Verify</a> but can be deleted if you provide a CLEAR explanation as to why. However, adding many sources for no valid reason would fall under <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OVERCITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OVERCITE">WP:OVERCITE</a> and is overkill to cite every destination, so similarly, please provide a reason for adding a source as well.

Even then, the articles use some interesting constructions like <span class="example deprecated-content example-bad" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #8B0000;">at the Khajuraho Airport</span> and <span class="example deprecated-content example-bad" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;DejaVu Serif&#39;, serif; color: #8B0000;">at Khajuraho airport</span>.

<p>Virgin America is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. Some users have changed the destination charts to say "Alaska Airlines operated by Virgin America." This is incorrect. Just like we list Eurowings completely separately from Lufthansa, we should continue to list Virgin America on it's own as it will operate as a separate airline for the time being. We screwed this up with Southwest/AirTran too when we listed it as Southwest Airlines operated by AirTran Airways and then swapped it to AirTran operated by Southwest.

<dd>I thought the slash names had been eliminated. I think it is best to just use "Punta Gorda". The Punta Gorda area (Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, North Port) has about 150,000 residents and it is not contiguous with the Fort Meyers metro area.

But Melbourne in Australia and Florida are not disambiguated. There is a London (ON) in Ontario but in the UK the airports are used (eg. London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick) and likewise Hamilton (ON) in Ontario but Hamilton in New Zealand is not disambiguated (both are small airports, the NZ one is domestic and the other serves the US and Canada). However, there are many examples of US cities that require a disambiguating abbreviation, in which case state abbreviations are needed:  Portland (OR) in Oregon and  Portland (ME) in Maine; Rochester (NY) in New York and Rochester (MN) in Minnesota; Columbus (OH) in Ohio and Columbus (GA) in the U.S. state of Georgia; and probably many more. I don't know of a better way of disambiguation that the most common abbreviation for the state/province or country and there should also be a policy on when disambiguation is necessary. <a href="/wiki/User:AHeneen" title="User:AHeneen">AHeneen</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHeneen" title="User talk:AHeneen">talk</a>) 04:21, 18 January 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<li><b>Option 1</b> Yes, remove these per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTDIRECTORY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTDIRECTORY">WP:NOTDIRECTORY</a>. It is very hard to maintain these (as routes tend to get updated frequently sometimes). I see quite a lot of unsourced information in multiple articles.

<li><b>Option 2</b>. A (sourced) list of airlines serving an airport provides scope without being too difficult to maintain and violating <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL">WP:NOTTRAVEL</a> (as the current charts are), but it also doesn't cross the line into <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a> the way option 1 seems to, as that requires creating a definition of what constitutes a significant airline for an airport.

<li><b>Option 3, but without listing terminals</b> - As explained in detail in my comment under the general discussion, destinations are an important element of the subject, as it conveys the connectivity and importance of the subject. The problem with using prose is that, particularly at large airports, it is difficult to prune the list down to the most important destinations. By trimming down the lists to a few destinations, it risks edit wars and may be too indiscriminate to be appropriate (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:INDISCRIMINATE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:INDISCRIMINATE">WP:INDISCRIMINATE</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Discriminate_vs_indiscriminate_information" title="Wikipedia:Discriminate vs indiscriminate information">Wikipedia:Discriminate vs indiscriminate information</a>). Discussion of destinations is an important aspect of the subject and should be included in airport articles. However, listing the terminal used for routes in the airlines &amp; destinations table is, in my opinion, a relatively unimportant aspect of the subject, falling under <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL">WP:NOTTRAVEL</a>, and should be removed. However, discussion of which airlines use which terminal is appropriate to mention in prose about the individual terminals. <a href="/wiki/User:AHeneen" title="User:AHeneen">AHeneen</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHeneen" title="User talk:AHeneen">talk</a>) 21:48, 23 December 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b>, I feel that the airlines and destinations table is one of the most important ingredients in the recipe for a good airport article. As I mention below I definitely feel that something must be done to make them more reliable. --<a href="/wiki/User:KDTW_Flyer" title="User:KDTW Flyer"><i><span style="color:red;">KDTW</span> <span style="color:#808000;">Flyer</span></i></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KDTW_Flyer" title="User talk:KDTW Flyer"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">talk</span></a>) 02:06, 30 December 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b> We have done a lot of work to improve these tables -- and they are widely used. <a href="/wiki/User:Tofutwitch11" title="User:Tofutwitch11"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;; color:Teal"><big>T</big><small>ofutwitch11</small></span></a><b> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tofutwitch11" title="User talk:Tofutwitch11"><font color="Orange">(T<small>ALK</small>)</font></a></small></sup></b> 03:59, 30 December 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b> I think these are really important and the only part of an airport article I am guaranteed to browse.  I do think however there is imprisonments in regards to references particular when it comes to referencing new scheduled routes announced by airlines which are clearly visible via their booking engines.  I don't feel it's really necessary unlike for example a charter service which can change frequently. <a href="/wiki/User:Jamie2k9" title="User:Jamie2k9">Jamie2k9 </a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jamie2k9" title="User talk:Jamie2k9">talk</a>) 01:41, 31 December 2016 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b> It would be a big step backwards to remove the destination tables, which are actually very useful and accurate the majority of the time. 19:50, 2 January 2017 (UTC)<a href="/wiki/User:VG31" title="User:VG31"><span style="font-family:&#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;,serif;color:green"><b>VG31</b></span></a></li>
<li><b>Option 3</b>. The destination lists are a great asset. They should be kept up to date, which I think they are. They should probably be referenced better. It is obvious that each airline website are used as source, but other used sources should be listed. If we decide to remove the destination lists for airports, we must as a minimum list all airlines using it, and in airline articles list all its destinations.--<a href="/wiki/User:BIL" title="User:BIL">BIL</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:BIL" title="User talk:BIL">talk</a>) 21:50, 2 January 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b>. Destination lists are very useful information, as multiple airlines and routes explose in Europe and elsewhere. I think it is all the more encyclopedic as it sources how important the airport is (1 route = little airport vs a long table = big airport for instance). A "As of date xx" should be written, so that one knows the "freshness" of information. Terminal/hall/jetway are however needless to my point of view. I furthermore think airport list should be wikidata-friendly (with lua code) so that only one change and the table would be visible in every wikilanguage and always "up to date".--<a href="/wiki/User:Bouzinac" title="User:Bouzinac">Bouzinac</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bouzinac" title="User talk:Bouzinac">talk</a>) 10:53, 3 January 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Option 3</b>. I think it would be a terrible idea to remove the tables for all airports. You can see my comment below for more of my opinions. I have no problems with adding sources, either on the airline name, or even in another column. The North America flight tables are some of the most up to date information on all the airport articles. Adding information dealing with which airlines use what gates, food/shops, transportation, etc. is much more of a travel guide than showing the extent that an airport is served. The whole reason an airport exists is to transport passengers on flights, so the flights at an airport are really the most notable information of all. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 14:03, 6 January 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Option 3</b> It is really important to list the destinations of an airline, but yes, something needs to be done regarding references, perhaps a separate column for references alone. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&#8212;<a href="/wiki/User:LeoFrank" title="User:LeoFrank"><span style="background:#8b008b;color:#FFFAFA"><b>&#160;LeoFrank&#160;</b></span></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:LeoFrank" title="User talk:LeoFrank"><span style="color:#006400"><b>Talk</b></span></a></sup></span> 04:41, 10 January 2017 (UTC)</li></ul>

All in all, the timetables are a hassle to maintain; and it is difficult for a reader to verify the information.

As an alternative, I think mentioning only notable airlines (e.g. airlines hubbed at the airport) and notable destinations (e.g. an airport's only international destination) is enough.</p></blockquote> — <span style="font-family:Calibri;"><a href="/wiki/User:Sunnya343" title="User:Sunnya343"><i>Sunnya343&#9992;</i></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sunnya343" title="User talk:Sunnya343">háblame</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sunnya343" title="Special:Contributions/Sunnya343">my work</a>)</span> 00:26, 16 December 2016 (UTC)
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/User:Sunnya343" title="User:Sunnya343">Sunnya343</a> can you explain a bit more about what you mean by notable airlines and notable destinations? The reason that I ask is for some airports if restricted to airlines that use it as a hub or their main base then they would have no airlines or charter airlines only. I would suspect that there plenty of airlines that are not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article but could still be referenced as existing and providing flights. <a href="/wiki/User:CambridgeBayWeather" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:CambridgeBayWeather" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">Uqaqtuq (talk)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/CambridgeBayWeather" title="Special:Contributions/CambridgeBayWeather">Sunasuttuq</a> 18:50, 17 December 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>I'm going to weigh in on this: these tables are really useful and are extremely important for showing how the airport is still in use today. For articles where there are barely any sources, I think the destinations should not be added without verified sources. I am of the opinion, though, that chartered routes should not be displayed or if they are, then indeed sources should be added. Removing these tables would be a mistake in my eyes. <b><a href="/wiki/User:St170e" title="User:St170e">st170e</a></b><sup><i><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:St170e" title="User talk:St170e">talk</a></small></i></sup> 22:21, 18 December 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>The question to me is what is encyclopaedic - what information enhances a reader's understanding of an airport in question and what is just unnecessary complexity?  In my view information on typical routes that are flown from the airport are of interest and should be covered in an airport article, such information indicates its busyness, its sphere of influence for example.  Likewise I suspect it is also interesting to cover the airlines that typically use the airport although I would consider this slightly less important than the routes.  What I am certain in my own mind is that the current pedantic matrix of these two concepts co-joined adds little more to the understanding of an airport than a much simpler splitting of these concepts into separate "lists".  The current matrix is very complex and full of unnecessary, uninteresting (to most readers - not you and me I know!) and often unverifiable detail.  The nature of how the route information is presented is of interest, I quite like the idea put forward above of it being explained in words - this is likely to be the best way to concentrate the necessary information, I would not be entirely opposed to separate lists of destinations and airlines that serve an airport, I'm also relatively in favour of route maps as a concise way to show such information in a graphical way - although there are good and bad ways of doing this.  <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 03:31, 19 December 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>I think that listing the destinations is just as important as listing the airlines, since the destinations indicate the connectivity of the airport to the world. The names of airlines don't necessarily indicate the country they fly to. <a href="/wiki/Orlando_International_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Orlando International Airport">Orlando</a> is a good example of this, as it is connected to every large US airport (except Honolulu), nearly every mid-size US airport east of the Mississippi River, every large and mid-size airport in Canada and many other international destinations, but that wouldn't be obvious in a listing of airline names (Norwegian flies to Oslo, but also London, Copenhagen, and (in July) Paris; Air Berlin will fly to Düsseldorf, not Berlin). Listing the destinations is really the only way to gauge the connectivity of the airport to the world at some hub airports where the hub airline operates most international routes with only few international airports (eg. <a href="/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport">Atlanta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Seattle–Tacoma International Airport">Seattle/Tacoma</a>, but not <a href="/wiki/Heathrow_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Heathrow Airport">London Heathrow</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Sydney Airport">Sydney</a>). In my opinion, I don't think it would be appropriate to list one of airlines or destinations without the other. While it is true that frequency of service matters, very few routes are less than weekly and the statistics section fills in that information gap. It is possible that major destinations and airlines could be listed in prose, but I think that would be subject to frequent edit wars over which destinations are significant enough to be mentioned and how many to list.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>In my opinion, there is no need to list the terminal the airlines use, as that is trivial information that would fall under the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL">WP:NOTTRAVEL</a> (but tables with such information may be welcome at <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikivoyage:Main Page">Wikivoyage</a>).

<dl><dd>We are often more accurate than airport websites. Many are not updated frequently.

<ul><li>I went with <b>option 3</b> because I feel that the airlines and destinations section is a good indicator of the size and notability of an airport (I consider larger airports to be more notable). But here's what I would change.... <b>1.</b> stop listing the same destination under multiple airlines, for example, you go onto an article like Chicago O'Hare and you see Atlanta for about 6 airlines. I feel that we should come up with a way to merge so these so Atlanta is only listed once. <b>2.</b> Get more strict on people listing starting, resuming and ending on the table with terrible or no citations given. <b>3.</b> Remove seasonal destinations and charters, most things listed under charter only run once and newer run again, to me this is just a place where editors place destinations that they are unsure about, they may see it once on Flightaware and list it there. <br /> I feel that we should just keep the current policy of only destinations that are starting and ending need citations. My argument for this is, there are people who travel on these routes everyday; if there were no such thing as that route anyone can come here and say this route does not exist and delete it. There are many tools out there to verify if a route is present such as Flightaware for most of the world. <a href="/wiki/User:KDTW_Flyer" title="User:KDTW Flyer"><i><span style="color:red;">KDTW</span> <span style="color:#808000;">Flyer</span></i></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KDTW_Flyer" title="User talk:KDTW Flyer"><span style="color:#FF8C00;">talk</span></a>) 05:31, 30 December 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Wikipedia is such a unique and incredible place. There is no where else on the internet where you can find a list of airlines/destinations like we have here on Wikipedia. If the issue is sourcing: every domestic flight can be sourced OAG Guides, which are published monthly. In addition, most airport websites provide a list of airlines and their respective destinations. I'd argue that they are encyclopedic as well -- the lists provide a good idea of which airlines operate the most routes, have the most business, and have the largest impact on the respective airports. It would be hard to have the same level of information in a paragraph. I'm not sure what <i>improvement</i> we would make by removing the tables. I think that would be a detriment to the project and to what we offer. We have done a great job at updating and modifying the tables -- and to see them go I think would be a huge blow to the project and everyone that has spent years keeping them accurate and up to date. <a href="/wiki/User:Tofutwitch11" title="User:Tofutwitch11"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;; color:Teal"><big>T</big><small>ofutwitch11</small></span></a><b> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tofutwitch11" title="User talk:Tofutwitch11"><font color="Orange">(T<small>ALK</small>)</font></a></small></sup></b> 04:06, 30 December 2016 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>In addition, I know many people across the industry that go to Wikipedia for the airline/destination tables. Even pilots will check Wikipedia -- as our level of accuracy often is greater than that of most airport websites. When Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia in 2001, did they think (or even want) Wikipedia would contain a comprehensive list of "Airlines &amp; Destinations" for nearly every commercial airport in the world? No -- of course not. But did they think that Wikipedia would have over 5.3 million articles (just in English) or that the article for NYC would be over 20,000 words long, and contain over 525 references? Doubtful -- but here we are. We spend so much time explaining what Wikipedia is <i>not</i> and not enough time stepping back to look at what is truly is. We're so much more than an encyclopedia. We're a global resource of information, used by everyone from elementary school students to scholars in all disciplines. In a generation where everything is moving forward, I think that removing these tables is a giant step backwards. <a href="/wiki/User:Tofutwitch11" title="User:Tofutwitch11"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;; color:Teal"><big>T</big><small>ofutwitch11</small></span></a><b> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tofutwitch11" title="User talk:Tofutwitch11"><font color="Orange">(T<small>ALK</small>)</font></a></small></sup></b> 04:43, 30 December 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Comment</b>: If the main problem is unverifiabilty/being out of date, this is really a problem for pages in Asia/Africa/Rural Europe. Just try adding a destination on a US Airport table and you will be reverted within a few minutes. The bigger problem is that we put these tables on all of the world's airports, when a majority of the editors are from North America and are focused on their local airports. I myself almost solely edit Ohio/Kentucky/West Virginia airports. The US destination tables are incredibly accurate and are some of the most up to date parts of Wikipedia. I think the destination tables are an incredible resource for the aviation industry, as the most important information about an airport is its connectivity to the world. Before I started editing on Wikipedia, I would often explore the tables out of curiosity to see what airlines fly where, there is no other source like it. Listing the destinations is not a travel guide, look at Wikitravel, Wikivoyage, etc. they do not list destinations, people fly the cheapest routes they find online. If the tables on Indian airports cannot be verified, remove the flights that cannot be verified, but do not remove everything just because parts of the table cannot be verified (I.e. Small Chinese Airlines, etc). Maybe we could put a header that the tables reflect the verified operating routes. Also, we could add a source to the airline name or in another column, if no source can be found (timetables should be accepted), remove the flights. Overall, I think many of Sunnya343's points really do not apply for North American airports. I know Sunnya343 and Andrewgprout are huge international editors of flights, however there are not many other dedicated users working on international destinations. So, I would not judge all of the flight tables based on certain regions where information on flights is lacking. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 13:58, 6 January 2017 (UTC)</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Option_3:_Next_steps">Option 3: Next steps</span></h4>
<p>I am seeing a lot of support for Option 3. If we are to go with this option, we need to address referencing. Issues with this led to this RfC in the first place. In particular, editors would be reverted for removing references for destinations that have begun, resulting in edit wars. Still, having one reference here, another there creates consistency issues; <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Airport#Passenger">here's an example</a>.
</p><p>My concerns: The tables have the appearance of being up-to-date, but they are not always. Also, the information is not easily verifiable for the average reader; and the fact that the "implicit reference" is the timetable may not be obvious to such a reader.
</p><p>The question: How do we properly reference these tables? And how do we note that the information may be outdated?

<dl><dd>I don't think there is a need for every single destination to have its own reference. One reference per airline, in the airline column, should be fine.

And there is also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.canadiannorth.com/">this</a>. There are a lot of destinations listed there but many are not direct flights and again the editors working on a particular airport are going to be aware of which ones are not valid. <a href="/wiki/User:CambridgeBayWeather" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:CambridgeBayWeather" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">Uqaqtuq (talk)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/CambridgeBayWeather" title="Special:Contributions/CambridgeBayWeather">Sunasuttuq</a> 12:33, 7 January 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>References must be there, either for each destination or for each airline.

<dl><dd>The "airline websites", OAG Guides, FlightAware and airport websites will be our best resources for many of them. For existing routes that have been operating for years, there will likely be little to no news coverage to cite. I think citing the airline website, "www.delta.com", should suffice. Anyone can then go into the booking system and verify the information for themselves. You can't actually cite a specific booking. FlightAware is another good tool, but again it is all based on "dates", so there's no use citing a flight from 6 months ago, as it is no proof that the flight operates currently. Airport websites are good resources as well, but many are very outdated, so perhaps we use them when we can (and we confirm they are up to date). Otherwise, we use the other sources. <a href="/wiki/User:Tofutwitch11" title="User:Tofutwitch11"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;; color:Teal"><big>T</big><small>ofutwitch11</small></span></a><b> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tofutwitch11" title="User talk:Tofutwitch11"><font color="Orange">(T<small>ALK</small>)</font></a></small></sup></b> 17:11, 7 January 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I actually really like the idea of referencing the airline website, the flight schedule would be even better, either on the airline name or in a new column. This should cover seasonal routes as well, since they should be listed on the schedule in the future. For airlines like Delta, we could cite their timetable instead. We could then continue to list sources for routes beginning, ending, or resuming, then remove those once the flights start. Also, challenged routes could retain a source if they cannot be found on the website. Example, please take a look, feel free to duplicate the table and make another proposal/change: <a class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stinger20/sandbox">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stinger20/sandbox</a> <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 20:25, 7 January 2017 (UTC)

<dd>I am in support of removing the terminal/concourse column, basically all the airports with multiple terminals and/or concourses have the terminal-airline assessment data posted, that data is not notable enough to be included in Wikipedia.

That is very important, I am currently learning Chinese, so I hope to being work on updating the airport pages in Chinese, but I think that should be raised on another topic as it goes beyond the simple verifiability raised in this discussion.

<dl><dd>Long/big tables can be collapsed/collapsible with a simple parameter in the template airport-dest-list so I don't think it is a serious problem. The problem of long tables already exist in the current template, for instance Atlanta airport with Delta having so many destinations from ATL, so the line of Delta destinations is about to be unreadable. However, I agree that it is a big challenge to modify all existing tables. May we imagine having two different templates (Airport, then companies // Companies, then airports) adapted to the size of airport? Or may we present big lines with a columns template such as in French page, line "Air France" <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destinations_au_d%C3%A9part_de_Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle" class="extiw" title="fr:Destinations au départ de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle">fr:Destinations au départ de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle</a> <a href="/wiki/User:Bouzinac" title="User:Bouzinac">Bouzinac</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bouzinac" title="User talk:Bouzinac">talk</a>) 08:59, 10 January 2017 (UTC)

<p>Hello KDTW Flyer, Stinger20 and other numerous aviation professionals .. as one who links the 
FAA with airport operations staff, airline staff and numerous local and regional political groups - the charts are very helpful and do reflect on airports well. I would be Pro use of searchable timetables as reliable source material and Against both any further edits of future/ending routes or charts of specific aircraft usage. Funding and/or politics change both
often, before quality editors can respond in that short time frame. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AirOpsExecnPlt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AirOpsExecnPlt (page does not exist)">AirOpsExecnPlt</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AirOpsExecnPlt" title="User talk:AirOpsExecnPlt">talk</a>) 01:43, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

<p>I see there have been some concern over using the airlines timetable/flight schedule to reference the destinations. I don't see a problem with it though.

<dl><dd>Remembering of course that each airline timetable is a Primary Source - and as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY">WP:PRIMARY</a> states considerable care needs to be taken with such sources - care which is often not taken, with entries often approaching Original Research for anything more than a route simply existing.  Secondary Sources are always better and should always be sought and kept above simply the timetable - the fact that such secondary sources are often hard to find suggests that the subject matter of these tables definitely have trouble being of a Tertiary (ie Encyclopedic) level.  It is not that the sources are poor it is that the content trying to be added in this instance is being stretched too far for an Encyclopaedia.   <a href="/wiki/User:Andrewgprout" title="User:Andrewgprout">Andrewgprout</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Andrewgprout" title="User talk:Andrewgprout">talk</a>) 00:22, 17 January 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Though, secondary sources are not always better. For instance, Taiwan news sources are reporting that DL is going to end NRT-TPE in May, however, Delta has not announced anything on the matter or changed anything in its schedule. While its possible Delta plans to end the route, these secondary sources are not always accurate, and we are not listing the route as ending until Delta says/schedules the end of the route. As you said, Primary sources can be used if they used with care. If an editor is not careful with the routes/does not source them, that is an edit that should be reverted. I think you have to be careful saying that secondary sources are always better, many writers take liberties with facts and rumors about all subjects, this is not limited to aviation. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 00:34, 17 January 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

Deciding whether primary, secondary or tertiary sources are appropriate in any given instance is a matter of good editorial judgment and common sense, and should be discussed on article talk pages". My point is that Primary sources are just as good, if not better in some cases, for referencing routes. As far as your statement that "core policies/Wikipedia policy" must be followed, a quote from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Policies and Guidelines</a>, "Although Wikipedia does not employ hard-and-fast rules, Wikipedia policy and guideline pages describe its principles and best-agreed practices. Policies are standards that all users should normally follow, while guidelines are meant to be best practices for following those standards in specific contexts. Policies and guidelines should always be applied using reason and common sense." All of the polices need to be put into context of a situation, just because its suggested that Secondary sources are better, this is not necessarily the case for everything. I would suggest that timetables/flightmapper/route maps are the best sources, followed by traditional secondary sources that have been verified. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 01:47, 17 January 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

If a fact only has Primary sources and it is hard to find a secondary source (ie as you say Primary Sources are the better reference) then it is really questionable whether that fact should be in Wikipedia, which is undoubtedly a tertiary source.  I some time ago suggested that those editing the destination tables gain some experience editing in a totally different part of Wikipedia  for some context (you guys must be interested in other things as well as airline timetables as interesting as I will admit they may be) I still believe that those here who have very narrow editing habits should edit Wikipedia generally and by this may understand why and how this all works, because at the moment the destination tables are way way out-there in the too detailed spectrum.

<p>I just wanted to say that, personally, I still have problems with option 3... I don't like the fact that references are typically the airline's schedule that has to be searched manually. There's also the fact that outdated information can be hidden in these tables, which do not indicate the date they were last updated. Here are recent examples: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McCarran_International_Airport&amp;diff=761196075&amp;oldid=760905617">here</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McCarran_International_Airport&amp;diff=761729382&amp;oldid=761196075">here</a>. Also, there are difficulties citing seasonal destinations. And, secondary sources are typically published when the route started, so they could be outdated. Overall, the tables are full of information that is plain difficult to cite... I still have doubts that any airport article could pass FA. Maybe I will have to try and see...
</p><p>Almost everyone who voiced support for Option 3 is an aviation enthusiast/regular editor of airport articles. And, only a few editors seem willing actually to discuss anything.

<dl><dd>I still don't think we are ready to submit this request. This would change airport articles for airports around the world -- and I don't think we are ready, nor do we have the capacity to update all of those articles at once. I think we should go article by article, get many of them done, and then go from there. <a href="/wiki/User:Tofutwitch11" title="User:Tofutwitch11"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;; color:Teal"><big>T</big><small>ofutwitch11</small></span></a><b> <sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tofutwitch11" title="User talk:Tofutwitch11"><font color="Orange">(T<small>ALK</small>)</font></a></small></sup></b> 15:40, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ok, I will change this on a few tables to see how it goes (CVG/CMH/DAY/LUK). These are not huge airports, so it should be a good place to start. I guess its not a huge deal if the ref column is sortable for the present, but we are going to need to change the template to fix this issue at some point. Since there are no objections to removing Terminals/Concourses, I will change this from the documentation on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Airports" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Airports">WP:Airports</a> so that we can gradually transition to sourcing refs in the 3rd column. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 21:10, 23 January 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that it is important to have the Concourse Information listed next to each airline, however there's no need to show which gates airlines use as airlines change or swap leased gates like people change shoes. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Captoza&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Captoza (page does not exist)">Captoza</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Captoza" title="User talk:Captoza">talk</a>) 20:31, 31 January 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The info really belongs in a paragraph about the terminals and the airlines using them. We are trying to steer away from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTRAVEL">WP:NOTTRAVEL</a> as well, and listing the concourses in the table of destinations is pushing that. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Stinger20&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stinger20 (page does not exist)">Stinger20</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Stinger20" title="User talk:Stinger20">talk</a>) 00:33, 3 February 2017 (UTC)

<p>Hello, the <a href="/wiki/Airports_Authority_of_India" title="Airports Authority of India">Airports Authority of India</a> publishes PDFs every month with traffic statistics for the airports it manages.

<dl><dd>I would say per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CALC" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CALC">WP:CALC</a> it would be fine to add the totals from each month to get the passengers per year, provided that you include all of the sources for each PDF.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Airport_names_in_local_languages">Airport names in local languages</span></h2>
<p>Pardon my ignorance here, but when did it become consensus that airport infoboxes should no longer contain the airport's name in the native language(s) of the city/country where it is located, and that in the text itself they should be prosified instead of being put inside parentheses?  I've checked the archives and there seems to be no indication that such a consensus was reached.
</p><p>I've looked at several airport articles both locally (I'm from the Philippines, so I'm appalled to see "This airport is also known as xxx in Filipino" when it was previously parenthesized) and abroad, and it looks like these edits have taken place within only the last few months. I'm loath to endorse the engineering of consensus based on changing the facts on the ground (i.e. edit articles the way you want, then force a new consensus based on those edits), so unless something has changed I'm seriously considering reverting things to how they previously were. --<a href="/wiki/User:Sky_Harbor" title="User:Sky Harbor"><font color="#0066ff"><b>Sky Harbor</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sky_Harbor" title="User talk:Sky Harbor"><font color="#0066ff"><b>talk</b></font></a>)</sup> 14:18, 27 February 2017 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Sky_Harbor" title="User:Sky Harbor">Sky Harbor</a>, may I ask what you find so appalling about that? You may have noticed that I made those edits. At <a href="/wiki/Mactan%E2%80%93Cebu_International_Airport" title="Mactan–Cebu International Airport">Mactan–Cebu International Airport</a> for example, I removed the native names from the infobox because there were two of them and it was adding to the length of the infobox. Also, I moved the translations out of the lead sentence per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEADCLUTTER" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEADCLUTTER">WP:LEADCLUTTER</a> and <a href="/wiki/MOS:FORLANG" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:FORLANG">MOS:FORLANG</a>: "a <i>single</i> foreign language equivalent name can be included in the lead sentence" (emphasis mine).

In fact, they can't even be booked and I've not been able to find a new start date anywhere. What would the consensus be on this issue?
