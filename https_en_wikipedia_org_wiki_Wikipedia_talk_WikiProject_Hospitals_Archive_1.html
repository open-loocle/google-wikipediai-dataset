</p><p>Is there anyone else in this project?  Did you properly propose it at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals">Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals</a> to see whether anyone else was interested?
</p><p>The primary purpose of a WikiProject is to have multiple editors work together, so the community avoids creating them for only one editor.  <a href="/wiki/User:WhatamIdoing" title="User:WhatamIdoing">WhatamIdoing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:WhatamIdoing" title="User talk:WhatamIdoing">talk</a>) 22:15, 25 November 2010 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Sorry, didn't see this for a while. I considered going through the proposal process, but that is more of a guideline than a requirement. There are several thousand hospital articles out there, most of them stubs. WP:Med sees them as a very low priority as they have 25,000 to work on. I knew that once this got going more people would join over time. I have noticed that there are a lot of people who will create hospital articles for only one region or country, which helps even if they don't join this project. <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 19:57, 4 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>It won't pass GA at this time.  Try addressing the tags currently in the article, and then carefully considering <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GACR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GACR">the GA criteria</a> (with, I'm sorry to say, an assumption that the reviewer is likely to require a higher standard than what is actually written there).  <a href="/wiki/User:WhatamIdoing" title="User:WhatamIdoing">WhatamIdoing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:WhatamIdoing" title="User talk:WhatamIdoing">talk</a>) 02:49, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I concur that it won't pass GA as is, but I haven't gone in depth to see whether the tag is valid. If we can spruce it up a bit more it would be a good candidate. Would be a first for the project! <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 04:24, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Yes, it was interesting. I am sure there have been a lot of editors that wanted to do something like this, but just never got around to it or didn't think they had the support. There have been a lot of editors who have been expanding hospital articles within other WikiProjects (states, regions) as well. By actually having a WP set up editors will be able to jump right in, rather than feel they have to organize something first. I considered the TF approach, but there are enough articles to justify the WP approach, and WP:Med is swamped with multiple TFs (many dormant) already. <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 21:02, 6 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Not to say there aren't any opportunities for collaboration with WP:Med, but they have enough to do and from the level of interest in previous edits and tagging, it seems like this is the way to go. <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 21:05, 6 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I have no firm opinion of project vs. task force, but a good question to ask (in terms of parentage) is: are all of the articles within the scope of this project also within the scope of WPMED?  To answer this, you'd need to ask WPMED if they want to include hospitals in their scope.  Hospitals were previously included, but this may be because no other project wanted to include them.  If WPMED wants to keep hospitals in its scope, making hospitals into a task force seems like the best option.  If WPMED does not want to include hospitals, then hospitals should be a parallel project to WPMED (similar to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Anatomy" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Anatomy">WP:Anatomy</a>).  Yes, WPMED has many quiet task forces, but many of these were inactive projects before being merged into the project as task forces.  Whether these "working groups" were task forces or projects, I'm sure their activity levels would be the same.  From my experience, the contributors at WPMED don't really care what is in the project's scope...everyone will work on whatever they want to work on and few care about which project claims assessment oversight of the article.  Ng.j, I've noticed that you have been replacing the WPMED banner with the WP hospitals banner.  I'd recommend you leave the WPMED banner in place until this scope issue is determined.  --<a href="/wiki/User:Scottalter" title="User:Scottalter">Scott Alter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scottalter" title="User talk:Scottalter">talk</a>) 22:47, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The alternative is to have WP:Hospitals as a daughter project, which is how I see it. I look at WP:Dams as an example, where it replaces WP:Engineering tags in all dam articles. It isn't very often that there is overlap, and people have been tagging with WP:Med simply because there was no alternative until now. <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 23:17, 6 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Just took a look at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Anatomy" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Anatomy">WP:Anatomy</a>, and though they are a seperate project, they consider themselves to be a daughter of WP:Med as well. <a href="/wiki/User:Ng.j" title="User:Ng.j">Ng.j</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ng.j" title="User talk:Ng.j">talk</a>) 23:25, 6 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Just want to preface my comments by saying I'm mostly playing devil's advocate here, as I think there should be a comprehensive discussion (or at least consideration of all options) before extensive changes are made.  Here's a quick summary of WP:Anatomy.  The project was started in 2005 distinct from the medicine projects at the time, but never went anywhere, and became inactive.  A few years ago, members of WPMED came to the consensus that anatomy articles are not within the scope of WPMED and should only be tagged with WP:Anatomy - even though the Anatomy project was inactive.  Currently, the WP:Anatomy project pages are still are inactive, but members of WPMED work on the anatomy articles and templates.  I don't think there are any people who contribute to WP:Anatomy and not WPMED.  Since WPMED decided not to include anatomy articles, the scopes of WP:Anatomy and WPMED are basically mutually exclusive.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NURSE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NURSE">WP:NURSE</a> is another project that is similar, but mutually exclusive.  I'd say that Anatomy and Nursing aren't daughter projects of WPMED, but rather "similar" or "parallel" projects.  WPMED hasn't really "accepted" any child projects, as any child projects that's scope was entirely within the scope of WPMED have been accepted as task forces.  If you ask at WT:Anatomy, if anyone responds, I'm not sure they would even say they are a child of WPMED.</dd>
<dd>Regarding WP:Dams and WP:Engineering, it is not up to WP:Dams to decide to replace WP:Engineering tags.  Every project can choose which articles they wants in their scopes.  If WP:Engineering has decided to defer all dam articles to WP:Dams (similar to WPMED deferring anatomy articles to WP:Anatomy), that's one thing, and okay.  But it's not okay for WP:Dams to remove WP:Engineering tags unless WP:Engineering approves.</dd>
<dd>People may have just been tagging hospital articles with WPMED because there was no alternative, but hospitals are currently within WPMED's stated scope (as it was stated at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MEDA">WP:MEDA</a> before you <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment&amp;diff=399003656&amp;oldid=397520563">changed</a> it a few days ago - without any discussion).  What needs to take place now is a discussion at WPMED whether it wants to include hospitals within its scope (in which case a hospitals task force would probably be better), or if it wants to defer all hospital articles to a separate, but parallel WP:Hospitals project.  I think it should be all or none, and not some vague "significant medical facilities" only included in WPMED.  --<a href="/wiki/User:Scottalter" title="User:Scottalter">Scott Alter</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scottalter" title="User talk:Scottalter">talk</a>) 00:57, 7 December 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Assessment_issues">Assessment issues</span></h2>
<p>I have been adding and/or assessing UK-based hospital articles for the past few days and have come across a couple of issues for discussion. I am not in any way affiliated with Hospitals, or this project, just saw it needed doing as I was looking at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WALES" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WALES">WP:WALES</a>.
</p>
<ol><li>Some articles contain the word <i>Hospital</i>, but they mean it in the old english sense of <a href="/wiki/Almshouse" title="Almshouse">almshouse</a>. Since there is no explicit mention of a medical context, I am assuming that these would not be in the scope of the project. See, for example, <a href="/wiki/Christ%27s_Hospital_of_Abingdon" title="Christ&#39;s Hospital of Abingdon">Christ's Hospital of Abingdon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donnington_Hospital" title="Donnington Hospital">Donnington Hospital</a>.</li>
<li>Some articles are not actually hospitals but rather other medical terms. I suggest these should not be in the scope of this project. I think the scope of the project should precisely be <i>Hospitals, clinics, and related organizations</i>. For example, what about <a href="/wiki/Vidant_Health" title="Vidant Health">Vidant Health</a> (no?), <a href="/wiki/Anesthesia_cart" title="Anesthesia cart">Anesthesia cart</a> (no), <a href="/wiki/Early_postnatal_hospital_discharge" title="Early postnatal hospital discharge">Early postnatal hospital discharge</a> (no), <a href="/wiki/Franciscan_Alliance,_Inc." class="mw-redirect" title="Franciscan Alliance, Inc.">Franciscan Alliance, Inc.</a> (no?), <a href="/wiki/AHMC" title="AHMC">AHMC</a> (no?)?<a href="/wiki/User:Welsh" title="User:Welsh">welsh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Welsh" title="User talk:Welsh">talk</a>) 19:52, 3 January 2013 (UTC)</li></ol>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Welcome and congratulations on receiving a non-revocable lifetime membership of this project.</dd>
<dd>1. I think you're correct; they're former medieval almshouses and should only be included if they subsequently developed into something resembling a hospital. Please remove any and all that you find.</dd>
<dd>2. Vidant health &amp; Franciscan Alliance Inc are hospital networks and AHMC is a hospital corporation - and I think all such networks and hospital governing bodies, such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)" title="National Health Service (England)">NHS</a>, definitely should be included. An anesthesia cart is a medical device and there's no need to include it or any other medical equipment. Early postnatal hospital discharge specifically addresses the impact of hospital stay periods and therefore I think it is relevant to this (moribund) project. <a href="/wiki/User:FiachraByrne" title="User:FiachraByrne">FiachraByrne</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FiachraByrne" title="User talk:FiachraByrne">talk</a>) 12:29, 9 January 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Since you have decided I am a lifelong member, I have joined! I have a number of reflections on WP:Hospitals which I will share here. There seems a low level of activity on the Project, but a fair bit of activity on Hospital articles in WP. I muse that worldwide, hospitals are characterised by being really important to their user community, but of almost no interest to anyone else. This rule of thumb seems to work for community facilities (Low importance), Regional (Mid), National (High) and Global (Top) levels, at least for current facilities. Now-closed facilities tend to drift downwards in importance.
</p><p>I am really only interested in UK hospitals, and note 2 anomalies that I would like to address:
</p>
<ol><li><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MED">WP:MED</a> was the precursor project and is now acknowledged as a sister project. There are c 200 articles that are anomalies in WP:MED and should be transferred. There will be a minority that should stay in WP:MED if there is a genuine Medical reason to be there.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Health_Service" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject National Health Service">Wikipedia: WikiProject National Health Service</a> is a defunct UK project that should be removed in favour of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Hospitals" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Hospitals">WP:Hospitals</a>. It has about 300 articles, many already in both projects.</li></ol>
<p>At a low level I have been implementing some of these changes, and ensuring that articles are tagged in WP:Hospitals. However, now I am exposing this activity for consultation before I proceed further. I will also post at WP:MED.
</p><p>I have also been standardising the assessment for the non-article Classes such as Project, Disambig, Category, Template to be NA, which is as hinted on the assessment guidance, but was not as implemented. This removes the wood from the trees on genuine articles on the Project assessment stats.<a href="/wiki/User:Welsh" title="User:Welsh">welsh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Welsh" title="User talk:Welsh">talk</a>) 21:47, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>What kind of articles are you referring to as anomalously part of WP:MED - they're all articles about hospitals I assume? We should probably ask at WP:MED if we're to remove them from that project but I'd wager they'd be happy enough for others to take responsibility for those articles.</dd>
<dd>I agree that if WP:NHS is dead the project banners should be replaced. Would it make sense to upmerge WP:NHS into this project?</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, I agree with your proposals. <a href="/wiki/User:FiachraByrne" title="User:FiachraByrne">FiachraByrne</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:FiachraByrne" title="User talk:FiachraByrne">talk</a>) 19:40, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ref WP:MED. It was agreed some time ago that WP:Hospitals would take hospital articles as a sister project to WP:MED. There are about 200 residual articles that should be removed from WP:MED as a tidying. (I will ask there first). Yes an <i>upmerge</i> may be what I am suggesting for WP:NHS, though that sounds rather grand. First I will look at the <i>xxx NHS Trust</i> type articles to convince myself they should be in scope. <a href="/wiki/User:Welsh" title="User:Welsh">welsh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Welsh" title="User talk:Welsh">talk</a>) 21:29, 11 January 2013 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scope">Scope</span></h2>
<p>I have added a <a href="/w/index.php?title=WikiProject_Hospitals&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="WikiProject Hospitals (page does not exist)">Scope</a> section to the main project page to help define (in fact mainly state the de facto position) for what is in and out of the scope of this project. Comments welcome. The one area that is an explicit expansion of scope, is to include the management organisations/companies that run hospitals. I think this is very relevant and related, and often provides more detail of smaller health facilities in a region. In the UK this would include many articles about the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a> structure, and would, in time, pave the way for the defunct WP:NHS to be merged here. <a href="/wiki/User:Welsh" title="User:Welsh">welsh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Welsh" title="User talk:Welsh">talk</a>) 23:28, 29 January 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I agree with including articles on management.  Regarding NHS, is there any utility or interest in keeping <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_National_Health_Service" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject National Health Service">Wikipedia:WikiProject National Health Service</a> or making it a task force of this project?  There are just over 300 articles tagged for that project.

<dl><dd>Currently WP:NHS is inactive. I guess there are maybe 800 articles that should be in scope. All the hospitals are now in WP:Hospitals, and eventually I will add all the NHS Trust articles too (as per the new scope definition). I am unsure whether there is any specific need or desire to maintain WP:NHS or a NHS task-force here. I have no view either way. <a href="/wiki/User:Welsh" title="User:Welsh">welsh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Welsh" title="User talk:Welsh">talk</a>) 23:55, 30 January 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Neither do I.  It could also become a WPMED task force, if the NHS seems to be bigger than hospitals and hospital-like things, or we could divide the articles between the two groups.  <a href="/wiki/User:WhatamIdoing" title="User:WhatamIdoing">WhatamIdoing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:WhatamIdoing" title="User talk:WhatamIdoing">talk</a>) 21:43, 5 February 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>As I begin to add infoboxes and update existing infoboxes with sourced bed counts, addresses etc., I'm noticing a lot of the larger US hospitals proclaiming numerous awards and distinctions that are either (a) very out of date ("Number two ranked for cardiac surgery by [insert random awarding entity] in 2006) or (b) leaps of logic as to something like government issued quality reports being construed as awarded ranking ("NY DOH found [insert hospital] to be the best at cardiac surgery in a report dated 2007.
</p><p>These awards or ranks or grades are certainly true for the most part, but have since been superceded by updated reports that places these hospitals lower, or not at all. What is the accepted notability of these sorts of findings? The language I'm finding is primarily cut and pasted from hospital Web site "About Us" pages and is either posted from IPs originating within the hospital or otherwise smells like PR language as oopsoed to notable, factual copy. I don't want to be heavy handed, but many of these articles are sourceless and clearly advertising copy at best. What is the group's stance on this sort of thing? <a href="/wiki/User:Mynameismonkey2" title="User:Mynameismonkey2">mynameismonkey</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mynameismonkey2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Mynameismonkey2 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:01, 28 October 2014 (UTC)

<p>There are a number of hospital articles that have recently had either a portal <a href="/w/index.php?title=Portal:Social_Welfare_and_Social_Work&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Portal:Social Welfare and Social Work (page does not exist)">Portal:Social Welfare and Social Work</a> or a template <a href="/wiki/Template:Social_work" title="Template:Social work">Template:Social work</a> added.

<dl><dd>I have read the discussion on both user talk pages. My view is that a blanket reference to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Portal:Social_Welfare_and_Social_Work&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Portal:Social Welfare and Social Work (page does not exist)">Portal</a> in all Hospital articles would not be appropriate - rather its use should be targeted at those articles where its inclusion is particularly relevant. In generic, global terms I do not think there is a one-to-one mapping between hospital institutions (the main focus of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Hospitals" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Hospitals">WP:Hospitals</a>) and Social Welfare and Social Work, though in practice on the ground they are often increasingly integrated, for example in Scotland. Perhaps a rule of thumb would be to include the Portal reference as part of a section that covers Social Welfare and Social Work.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Aem1009" title="User:Aem1009">Aem1009</a> Hello. In the case of organizations, including hospitals, Wikipedia avoids reporting <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SPS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SPS">what organizations say about themselves</a> and instead reports what external information sources say.

<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Aem1009" title="User:Aem1009">Aem1009</a> It is difficult to find sources. The communications policy of maybe 90% of hospitals is to prevent the publication of any information about the hospital except what their official spokespeople say about themselves. Writing about hospitals is difficult in Wikipedia for sure.</dd>
<dd>I would not know where to find it, but probably somewhere there are government reviews or audits of the hospital. If you can find one of those reports then that is best, because they can be trusted to identify special features and highlight any problems that exist. <a href="/wiki/User:Bluerasberry" title="User:Bluerasberry"><span style="background:#cedff2;color:#11e"><b> Blue Rasberry </b></span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bluerasberry" title="User talk:Bluerasberry"><span style="background:#cedff2;color:#11e">(talk)</span></a> 13:35, 25 September 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Since <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Hospitals" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Hospitals">WP:Hospitals</a> has been placed on the articles and so rather than introducing <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MED">WP:MED</a> separately would it not be a better idea to introduce a parameter like <code>{{WikiProject Hospitals | class= | importance= |education=yes |education-imp=Mid}}</code> or <code>{{WikiProject Hospitals | class= | importance= |med.ed=yes |med.ed-imp=Mid}}</code> within the scope of WP:Hospitals?

<p>Greetings. Vince from Kaiser Permanente here. Kaiser Permanente has completed the acquisition of Group Health Cooperative, based in Seattle. Each organization has an existing Wikipedia page. To better organize this content, it seems like we should merge the Group Health page somehow into the Kaiser Permanente page. How can I best pursue this goal?

<dd>Group Health still has its own history as an organization and the merger does not change that history. If the GH article were merged, then that might put the extra weight of that organization's history on the KP page giving undue weight to GH in the narrative of KP. The GH page should be updated to indicate that its future is in a merge with KP. Usually both pages would be kept. What would you hope to accomplish by a merge? Do you want something more complicated than a note on GH saying that it was acquired by KP? <a href="/wiki/User:Bluerasberry" title="User:Bluerasberry"><span style="background:#cedff2;color:#11e"><b> Blue Rasberry </b></span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bluerasberry" title="User talk:Bluerasberry"><span style="background:#cedff2;color:#11e">(talk)</span></a> 22:11, 6 March 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Helipad_Cost_to_Hospitals">Helipad Cost to Hospitals</span></h2>
<p>How much does a helipad add to the cost of a building.  As you can see in the foreground, the Mt. Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, has several helipads, ranked for different weights of helicopters:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0718989,-118.3789237,525a,35y,39.33t/data=!3m1!1e3">https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0718989,-118.3789237,525a,35y,39.33t/data=!3m1!1e3</a>  The one in the center is ranked "15," for 15,000 pounds, while the one in the back left is ranked "12" for 12,000 pounds.
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how much it costs to add such a helipad to the roof of a building, and how much more it adds to the cost to increase the poundage to support heavier and heavier helicopters?
</p><p>If so, you could add it to the Wikipedia Helipad page: <a class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helipad">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helipad</a>  <small class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2602:306:31EB:2EC0:F8DD:9DBA:8A67:71F5" title="Special:Contributions/2602:306:31EB:2EC0:F8DD:9DBA:8A67:71F5">2602:306:31EB:2EC0:F8DD:9DBA:8A67:71F5</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2602:306:31EB:2EC0:F8DD:9DBA:8A67:71F5&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2602:306:31EB:2EC0:F8DD:9DBA:8A67:71F5 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:06, 12 April 2017 (UTC)</small>

<p>I'm editing some of the lists of hospitals by state, and I don't know what should be considered a hospital. Do multiple buildings of the same hospital need to be listed separately?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_photo_for_Cleveland_Clinic">New photo for Cleveland Clinic</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I am Eileen Sheil, executive director of corporate communications at Cleveland Clinic. I created <a href="/wiki/Talk:Cleveland_Clinic#New_photos_request" title="Talk:Cleveland Clinic">this edit request</a> to add two new photos to <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic" title="Cleveland Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a>. One of them has been added to the article, but <a href="/wiki/File:Taussig_Cancer_Center.png" title="File:Taussig Cancer Center.png">File:Taussig Cancer Center.png</a> has not. Are there editors here who might help if the photo is deemed appropriate? As I am an employee at Cleveland Clinic, I have disclosed and discussed my conflict of interest, and will avoid direct editing.

<dl><dd>Hello! I'm not an official project member but I work on improving articles of Hospitals around Central Ohio. I will attempt to make sure it is appropriate but to be clear, the photo must illustrate something in the article. Are you proposing exchanging your photo for <a href="/wiki/File:Cleveland_Clinic_Taussig_Cancer_Center.jpg" title="File:Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.jpg">this</a>? It is a shame the cancer center isn't described in more detail since I'm sure it would be worthwhile to do so. I don't feel qualified to do that but it would make it easier to know where the photos would fit best. All of that aside, I believe a OTRS ticket on Commons where you hosted the files is in order since I don't think you yourself took the image and it is owned by you unless I'm wrong. Assuming I'm not wrong, that would clarify that you, the copyright holder explicitly grants permission for the distribution of the files under a free license.  -- <a href="/wiki/User:Sixflashphoto" title="User:Sixflashphoto">Sixflashphoto</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sixflashphoto" title="User talk:Sixflashphoto">talk</a>) 18:13, 17 October 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hello, <a href="/wiki/User:Sixflashphoto" title="User:Sixflashphoto">Sixflashphoto</a>. The photo <a href="/wiki/File:Taussig_Cancer_Center.png" title="File:Taussig Cancer Center.png">File:Taussig Cancer Center.png</a> was taken by a photographer employed in the Cleveland Clinic's Art &amp; Photography Department, so the copyright belongs to Cleveland Clinic. I uploaded the photo to Wikimedia Commons on behalf of Cleveland Clinic, therefore releasing the image under a CC BY 4.0 license.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The intent of the photo is to replace the existing Taussig Cancer Center photo in the <i><a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic#Reputation" title="Cleveland Clinic">Reputation</a></i> section of <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic" title="Cleveland Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a> with the new Taussig Cancer Center building that opened in March 2017.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:ClevelandClinicES" title="User:ClevelandClinicES">ClevelandClinicES</a>:</span> There is a bureaucratic matter to resolve. When we get photos from institutions we need proof by email of the copyright. Typical proof is getting an email from an official email address. That email is mostly private in a system described at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OTRS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a>, but the receipt of the email is publicly tagged on the image so that we know that we can share it. Can you send an email as described at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email_templates#Declaration_of_consent_for_all_inquiries" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Email templates">Commons:Commons:Email_templates#Declaration_of_consent_for_all_inquiries</a>? I recommend using that email generator in the button, but the text is there otherwise. The image looks great and if you can sort the copyright as an organization (which will be required upon review anyway) then I can post the image into the article. It is a striking image.</dd>

<p>The reason I am contacting you is because there are one or more portals that fall under this subject, and the Portals WikiProject is currently undertaking a major drive to automate portals that may affect them.
</p><p>Portals are being redesigned.
</p><p>The new design features are being applied to existing portals.
</p><p>At present, we are gearing up for a maintenance pass of portals in which the introduction section will be upgraded to no longer need a subpage. In place of static copied and pasted excerpts will be self-updating excerpts displayed through selective transclusion, using the template &#123;&#123;<a href="/wiki/Template:Transclude_lead_excerpt" title="Template:Transclude lead excerpt">Transclude lead excerpt</a>&#125;&#125;.
</p><p>The discussion about this can be found <b><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Portals#AWB_team_please_tackle_maintenance_run_on_intro_sections" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Portals">here</a></b>.
</p><p>Maintainers of specific portals are encouraged to sign up as project members <b><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Portals#Specific_portal_maintainers" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Portals">here</a></b>, noting the portals they maintain, so that those portals are skipped by the maintenance pass.  Currently, we are interested in upgrading neglected and abandoned portals. There will be opportunity for maintained portals to opt-in later, or the portal maintainers can handle upgrading (the portals they maintain) personally at any time.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>On April 8th, 2018, an <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/RfC:_Ending_the_system_of_portals" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/RfC: Ending the system of portals">RfC ("Request for comment") proposal was made to eliminate all portals and the portal namespace</a>.  On April 17th, the Portals WikiProject was rebooted to handle the revitalization of the portal system. On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.
</p><p>There's an <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/WikiProject_report" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2018-05-24/WikiProject report">article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject</a>.
</p><p>Since the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.
</p><p>So far, 84 editors have joined.
